20-01-2023,1382,"300,000+ Tech jobs have been vanished in the last 12 months. (Sad but true fact)",Based on your chart it's 200k+ in the past six months,Someone else posted something similar but instead their graph showed the total employment of Microsoft since 2018 I believe. It showed how it went on a hiring spree and simply hired too many employees too quickly. From 2021 to 2023 it still had a considerable gain in employees even after layoffs. The narrative should be tech companies have had a net positive gain in employees since the pandemic and are now addressing the pandemic hiring craze by cutting staff but still resulting in a net gain.,If my data viz was this bad I would deserve it

11-09-2023,1114,It be like this now,So many job descriptions now asking for “5+ years experience training LLMs” for positions where it makes absolutely no sense.,"Whenever a managerial person asks whether you have experience in LLMs in a interview, just ask them what business problem they are looking to solve with it and watch them start stuttering because they have a very poor idea of what an LLM is and what they do.","Man, it's crazy. 4 years ago everyone was begging for ML just because ""everyone else wants ML, so I want ML too,why? I have no idea, but I need ML anyways"", now it's the same but with AI and LLM's"

So, how much is his course?","I mean that would be great, if it was any less than a crapshoot to land a legit entry level DS/DA job with no Bachelor’s degree or other relevant experience.

No you don’t need a degree to learn the skills necessary to do the job. Yes college is overpriced and often behind the curve on new skills/tech. And yes I know people who have had this turn out well for them. But being able to do the job is not the same as being able to land the job, and with the competition in the space right now I think young aspiring DS/DAs should approach this advice with caution.

I notice that a lot of the loudest voices saying you don’t need a degree are the ones who have an alternative to promote. I wonder why that is?","It’s very r/restofthefuckingowl kind of advice. 

Competition at entry-level is very fierce, a lot of companies won’t even consider an applicant without a degree."

I once had an interview and the guy told me he thought I would be much prettier.

17-03-2023,875,I hire for super senior data scientists (30+ years of experience). These are some question I ask (be prepared!).,I'm surprised you don't ask if they can fix your mom's computer and build you a web page too.,"Weirdly at the end of my physics degree we had a module that was basically ""if you're gonna call yourself a physicist normal people are gonna expect you to just know..."" that wasn't a million miles away from this kind of thing",Is this a reference to some odd post in this sub lately?

17-05-2023,862,"I posted for a Data Analyst, this is what you are competing against","So I guess the obvious takeaway is that there's just a ton of noise to sift through, which has definitely been my experience when reviewing resumes for remote data science positions.

But another takeaway is that you got (at least) 4 properly-qualified applicants and another 2 maybe-overqualified applicants from 12 hours' worth of applications. So if you left the posting up for a week, you'd probably get more qualified applicants than you'd ever want to interview, albeit not until after wading through 1000+ obviously unviable ones.",How will I get my Data science job with all these scary tales,">Two were overqualified. Their experience was legitimately as data engineers. I assume they actually read the posting, so they remain in consideration, but their skills are beyond the specifics I need. I can't justify paying them more unless I can find ways that benefit the org to use those extra skills. I assume they will drop themselves from consideration when we talk more, so if I were in a time crunch, I would cut them from my list.

I am generalizing, but typically government jobs are not about making money, they’re about providing a public service.

06-04-2023,666,"Pandas 2.0 is going live, and Apache Arrow will replace Numpy, and that's a great thing!",Thanks for this helpful post!,"The performance shittiness of pandas is a large part of why I've started moving things into rust as I productionize them. 

They still don't really have a way to address the largest issue which is that it can be tremendously hard to maximize machine utilization in python due to the GIL, and doing so requires time-consuming backflips to avoid python code. 

All I want is to saturate my workstation's cores when processing data, every time, without having to think about it. I don't need something insane and large like spark, just a programming environment that isn't hobbled by bad decisions where parallelization works the way it should, constant factors are low on strings and common data structures, and there is zero penalty for ""using the language"". I just want to see 3200% CPU in \`top\` when I'm waiting for steps to run. Is that so much to ask? 

The downside of Rust is that it's a pretty picky language to code in. Nothing's perfect, but I write the code for production batch pipelines once and wait for it to run hundreds or thousands of times, so spending a little longer up front generally works out for me .",Polars ✌️

It just sounds like you're sufferring from cog-in-the-machine-nia. It's a common ailment.

Data Science is incredibly valuable but what you're possibly learning is that the use case development,, the available data and the confidence of the output are critical factors in your delivery.","I’m in a similar position and quickly found that you have to be your own biggest advocate for elevating your contribution (and the depth of your analysis) otherwise you’ll only get inbound requests and end up in a reporting function like you’ve described. Identify valuable opportunities to inform the business/product direction, identify the corresponding projects to accomplish that, and advocate for yourself to execute them.

Having said that, this is a shit take will just lead to burn out or resentment of co-workers when the extra work goes unnoticed/unappreciated. 

If you're really so career focused that you have the blinders on 24/7 for real life, idk maybe talk to a therapist, or try getting a hobby/volunteering. At worst, you might become a more well rounded and interesting person. At best you might be more efficient at work and probably a more pleasant co-worker.

Step 3: Uhh if I'm going to stay on track with this timeline there's no way I'm going to spend days rewriting everything, I'm just going to send this enormous notebook to the team and call the problem solved, they can probably figure out which cells are important and how it all fits together

Is your team skill based or product based? Ie do you only have data scientists or also engineers, devops etc within the team to quickly work together on deliver end functionality?  
 
I've seen too many data scientists strive to be experts of DL or statistics only, so should the common data scientist not strive to also be able to a certain extent to build ETL pipelines, know coding workflow and best practices vs notebooks and scripting, and have ""jack of all trades"" skills throughout the stack?

As a result a lot of the early work of a head of data science is enablement.

I had been working as a data analyst and after picking up my masters in data science I wanted to transition to a data scientist position.  I did some ml work at my previous job and obviously during my degree program and for my final project.

The hiring manager asked me about some of the models that I've used before and how I'd use them and I mentioned those that I've used in the professional context and for my major project. 

The interviewer then asked me whether I had used another type of model.  I said while I'd gone over it in my coursework I never used it in a business context.  I explained that I wanted to use the best model for the job and not to force fit an inappropriate models just because I wanted to use it in the real world.

She told me that was the perfect answer and then we went on a 5-minute discussion about how she immediately rejected an otherwise good candidate who kept insisting on using deep learning models to solve every problem.  She said that wasn't the first time it had happened.

08-09-2023,469,R vs Python - detailed examples from proficient bilingual programmers,"From my experience **Python excels** (vs R) when you move to writing production-grade code:

- in my experience base Python (dicts, lists, iterating strings letter by letter) are much faster than base types in R
- better OOP system than R's set of S3/S4/R6
- function decorators
- context managers
- asynchronous i/o
- type hinting and checking (R has a package typing that has something along these lines but nowhere to the level what Python has in terms of say Pydantic and mypy)
- far more elaborate set of linting tools, e.g. black and flake8 trump anything in R
- new versions and features coming far more quickly than R
- data orchestration/automation tools that work out of the box, e.g. Airflow, Prefect (stupid easy learning curve, slap few decorators and you have your workflow)
- version pinning, e.g. pyenv, poetry,  basically reproducible workflows
- massive community support, unlike R, Python doesn't rely on one company (Posit) and bunch of academics to keep it alive. 
- FAANG companies have interest in developing not only Python packages but language itself, even more so with Global Interpreter Lock removal
- web scraping, interfacing with various APIs even as common as AWS is a lot smoother in Python
- PySpark >>> SparkR/sparklyr
- PyPI >>> CRAN (CRAN submission is like a bad joke from stone age,  CRAN doesn't support Linux binaries(!!!)


**R excels** in maybe lower number of other places, typically statistical tools, specific-domain support (e.g. bioinformatics/comp bio) and exploratory data analysis, but in things it is better it is just *so good*:

- the number of stats packages is far beyond anything in Python
- the number of bioinformatics packages is FAR beyond Python (especially on Bioconductor)
- tidyverse (dplyr/tidyr especially) destroys every single thing I tried in Python, pandas here looks like a bad joke in comparison
- delayed evaluation, especially in function arguments, results in some crazy things you can do wrt metaprogramming (e.g. package rlang is incredible, allows you to easily take the user provided code apart, supplement it, then just evaluate it in whatever environment you want... which I am sure breaks bunch of good coding practices but damn is it useful) 
- data.table syntax way cleaner than polars (again thanks to clever implementation of tidy evaluation and R-specific features)
- Python's plotnine is good, but ggplot2 is still king - the number of additional gg* packages allows you to make some incredible visualizations that are very hard to do in Python
- super-fluid integration with RMarkdown (although now Quarto is embracing Python so this point may be moot)
- even though renv is a little buggy in my experience, RStudio/Posit Package Manager is fantastic
- RStudio under very active development and IDE for exploratory work is in some specific ways better than anything for Python including VSCode (e.g. it recognizes data.frame/data.table/tibble contexts and column names and previews are available via tabbing)","I wouldn’t build a web server with R. But anything with statistics I would use R. Practically, I would use python for data acquisition. Web scraping, API interaction, automated SQL stuff. But then use R to create models and run analytics on that acquired data.","I'll tell you why python is the better of the two languages for me: some of my coworkers know it.

I'm one of 2 data scientists at a company of 50-ish people that consists largely of software developers. Most of my work is part of our product (as opposed to business intelligence). Even if I'm the one doing the ""data science"" of developing a model, putting it into production is a team effort.

23-05-2023,431,Job is a nightmare - Advice,"It sounds like they’re skipping the step of hiring a data engineer. You’re not meant to be juggling systems. As you’ve said, and it sounds like they’ve agreed, you want to analyse data, get insights and maybe transform them into actionable objectives. 

First suggestion; get looking for another job. They’re naive and young and while you can learn a lot of skills if you manage this correctly, they probably won’t appreciate what you’re achieving by doing so.

Second suggestion; while you’re looking for a new job, take advantage of the heap of responsibility that has been balanced on your shoulders. Having some data engineering skills on your CV would serve you well. Tell your manager that you can’t help them benefit from their data until their data is in an orderly condition. Support your statement with links and evidence, and most importantly, research and bring the solutions to them. Do not bring problems. (1) they won’t know how to handle them (2) they will think you’re making excuses. 

You’ll need some data pipelines and if you want them off your back for a little bit, invest some time in PowerBI. Build some pretty graphs and they’ll be eating out of your hand. Remember that half the battle of dealing with stakeholders is presenting the information to them in a way that they understand and unfortunately even bad information is received better in a nice dashboard over groundbreaking information.

I wish you the best of luck. Feel free to DM me for more information, if I can help, I will. As a woman in DS, I’ve experienced the stress and anxiety you’re going through (probably with a sprinkle of imposter syndrome too). 

Good luck OP ☺️",Try to automate as much as you can from the presentations and maybe do an ingestion pipeline that would connect and ingest the data from the 5 systems into 1 where you can handle it better.

2. Enforce boundaries at work.

3. Don’t take work outside of your work hours. Hard workers get more work and not more pay unless you overemploy, but that’s not the right job to OE.

4. Most jobs suck and will be a bad fit. Navigate that environment and learn to appreciate the game if you can.

25-06-2023,429,Why is there no interest in Business Analytics?,"In BA,  you have to deal with non-technical actors, who are business oriented, and have no time or patience for the science and details behind any analysis. If they dislike probabilities, for example, if they have a ""just give me a simple yes or no"" attitude, or if they only want simple descriptives in flashy dashboards... it just feels like you end up not doing anything meaningful or deep with the data, and instead end up like serving their confirmation bias, dumbing down any potential analysis and inference, and accommodating to their non-analytical aesthetical needs.","Because the pay is worse, the work is arguably not as respected, and DS provides more optionality for future roles.

IMO, at a big company, the value that a great BA/DA adds over an average one can be greater than the incremental value of a great DS or MLE over an average one. But that's a pretty idiosyncratic take, and the way companies pay BAs/DAs makes it crystal clear that they don't agree with me.","I think it's the thought that 'DS is the sexiest job from this decade'. DA looks like an assistant job compared to DS in those people's minds. It's not so sexy. You're not a ~scientist~.

08-08-2023,428,How do you politely handle a very new data scientist with a PhD,"First, explain them in reasonable terms why their solution is inappropriate. They should be able to understand a reward/cost trade-off situation.

Now, because ""they know better"", you may have to switch to a more stiffed tone, which is definitely annoying and exhausting. But I think it is par of the course for a manager, to be able to have more ""difficult"" conversations.

Also assess whether some of their criticism is valid in regards to specific problems at hand. Do remind them that experience is highly valued in this (your) company, and that professional courtesy is expected. That being able to be part of a team and work together is one of the key skills they were looking for when hiring for their position.

Give them two to four weeks, and if they don't show any improvement, well, start looking for someone else.","I think folks are being a little harsh. We were all new to the workforce at one point, and we all made dumb mistakes.  Personally, I think direct and honest communication is best. Regarding belittling team members, I would just say something like, ""We don't speak negatively about our fellow teammates here.  We work as a team, and we all have our strengths and weaknesses. My expectation is that I won't hear you speaking negatively about any of our teammates.  Is that something you can do?""

Regarding butting heads, sometimes this happens, but for the most part, it should not. Again, direct communication is the way.  On the other hand, if they think they have a better way, give them a bit of time to try it out. They either learn a lesson or you get a better solution. I know that over my career, I have both been both humbled and proved some folks wrong in similar situations.","You've got two sides of the spectrum.

Then you have a fresh grad, pummelled through a master's and PhD. New to the corporate side of things, but chock full of the newest research and practices being taught.

You can't discredit 15 years of experience just because of the baseline education. You also can't discount the dedicated time to achieve a PhD and the research mindset they have. 


It needs to be a conversation of ""While your solution WOULD improve the model and you are correct, the current budget and time constraints require us to continue pursuing XYZ. Please continue bringing solutions to us, and as a team we will see what is feasible to implement in the future.""

I disagree that DS is dead, it just means that you should know how to transform your prototype into a working solution",Why are you taking life advice from people who think Tweeting is part of a career?,"This is only true for DS that only provide value by building predictive models (I’m a DS with experience at Meta and Google and have comfortably cleared the interviews at places like Netflix and Airbnb). 

There’s a whole world of DS that involve leveraging causal inference (both experimental and observational) that doesn’t require SWE skills. I get paid $$374k (439k now due to stock appreciation) to do this at Google.

There’s also product strategy focused DS that doesn’t require SWE skills but can still pay very well and add enormous business value. Many people would call them “just DAs” or “SQL monkeys” but the typical strong DA or product DS will have far more face time with the director, VP, and SVP product leadership layer of the company than the typical strong MLE. They can use that experience to jump into the DS director layer and be less limited by the absence of SWE skills. However you have to essentially operate as a management consultant or product manager that’s unusually data driven. 

While I have good SWE skills — I’ve deployed production ML models and been fully integrated into the software development teams of FANNG SWEs — and I have very strong stats skills — I’m on the “technical” side of the DS divide at Google — I deeply respect the non-technical DA-type DS.

I strongly recommend this blog, written by the chief decision scientist of google, to get a better perspective of the value different DS can bring: https://towardsdatascience.com/data-sciences-most-misunderstood-hero-2705da366f40. (I don’t agree with everything she says, I think she unnecessarily discourages DS from having a strong point of view of product direction.

Apologies if this is rude/presumptious, but your next step should be to research applications of DS/ML in your particular industry and then, armed with that knowledge, figure out where the opportunities in your company are.

When it comes time to productionize the code, I pull the functions out into python scripts, package the scripts into a whl file, and then upload the whl file to our Databricks clusters that run in our QA and prod environments. Doing so allows me to set up unit testing suites against the scripts in the whl file. We still use notebooks to train our models in production, but the notebooks are basically just orchestrating calls to the functions in the python scripts and registering trained models to MLFlow.","As one of the haters of Jupyter overkill, it's not that black-and-white.

 I'll put most of my data pulls, modeling code and visualization into scripts. But then I'll import\_and\_run from the notebook. Visualizing and EDA in particular I agree is nice in the notebook, and I might even do a lot of that in the notebook itself.

Doing a lot of modeling and data transformations code in the notebook itself though can become a mess for me to manage and iterate on, because notebooks don't lend themselves well to modularity.

We can’t go re-run the experiment, so I’m having to get something out of these results. It’s kind of hard to explain the nuances of tests to non-technical people, but once I reframed it in the way you are highlighting, I saw a lot of progress."
09-05-2023,365,PSA: You don't need fancy stuff to do good work.,"Tools are created to solve problems. If you haven't encountered those problems it isn't obvious why you should use a (more advanced) tool over an obvious approach.

People tend to go in different directions:

* camp A follows the flavour of the month and they're stuck with a microservices architecture running on managed k8s in the cloud that creates *no* value whatsoever. They're doing it for the sake of doing it.
* Camp B wants to do everything in the simplest way possible which means they're forever doing the same thing be it Excel, notebooks, data warehousing or dashboards  (depending on their maturity) even when there's room to grow in IT/data maturity and create more value.

Both are bad.

**Something that I think about is the correlation between big tech and their fancy stuff.** Is the relationship causal in the sense that: big tech -> fancy stuff *or* is it fancy stuff -> big tech.

You can rule the latter out because managed K8S doesn't magically bring you to FAANG's revenue. What we can say however is that big tech isn't shy of using advanced tools/methods when they're necessary so the approach of camp B is certainly wrong as well.

I think it's all down to realising that you're in *science* which means that you need to experiment within your domain and also (on a small scale) with your tools.","As long time emacs user (I primarily use VScode now), I think you discredit yourself by arguing that simplicity is key and, oh yeah, the average DS should use VIM or emacs 😀.

More seriously, I think the part that is missing is investing in domain knowledge. Then, sometimes a quick analysis is needed and you can use simple tools; but sometimes though your part of a much larger org with more complicated needs and you need to invest in serious tooling.",Is this a chatgpt post?
06-06-2023,367,What are the brutal truths about working in Data Science (DS)?,"Many companies don't actually want to be data driven, they just want us to tell them what they want to hear.

The companies that actually are data driven are gold though, but rare.","Your data is never clean/ready and it can be a huge pain if not impossible to get it 100% clean. 

Good enough is often fine and you can move on to something else. Spending your time making something perfect is often not worth the effort. 

Some people have horrible data literacy and you really have to spoon feed them your insights and recommendations and even then they still might not really understand. 

You can have amazing technical and mathematical skills but if you suck at communication, no one (important) will know and that will hinder your career. 

What we want data science to be and what the business actually needs are often two different things. 

Most businesses will never hire as many data scientists/analysts as they truly need because we don’t make money. My company easily has enough work/demand for our DS/analytics team to be 2x its size or more. But we don’t build the product so budget for new positions almost always goes to software eng. Or data eng. I think this got lost in the “data scientist is the most in demand job.” Just because it’s in demand doesn’t mean every company will hire as many people as they need.

Most DS jobs are focused on making more money. Without capitalism/profits, this field would just be a small subset of something else.","All the fun stuff is expensive so you need to either

* Leave to places that do it
* Fight an uphill battle in your org to make money free for it
* Make peace with the fact you're not going to do it"
05-02-2023,361,isn't this just too much for a take home assignment?,"At first I thought this was homework, for which I was like, “yeah that’s totally reasonable especially if you’re given up to two weeks for it,” but no, as a take home exercise for an application, I agree that this is just doing their work for them. Not to say that a role can’t have a take home challenge, but I would trim it down *a lot* and suggest the candidate focus on one or two of those tasks for their proof of competence","I’m generally not a fan of open-ended take home assignments; they disproportionately favor candidates with more free time, e.g. young, child-free, etc. You can imagine the many ways in which they ignore great candidates with other responsibilities.

It’s hard to say if this is fair without knowing the complexity of the algorithm they’re asking you to develop (or are you only evaluating a given one?) That said, the rest of this doesn’t seem totally crazy to me. For example, assuming it’s done in Python, I would expect a senior-level candidate to:

- be able to easily create Python package to make this reproducible (reproducible in most cases of course, bonus point for writing a Docker file but *absolutely* not expected)
- write clean, commented code in a script
- run said script on given data
- generate a few useful plots
- summarize in a slide
- outline thoughts on deployment, not actually deploying. IMO this just gives them an idea of where you’re at in terms of deployment. If the answer is “hand off to ML engineer”, that’s fine. That may or may not suite their needs. 

This is a good-faith interpretation of the assignment. And again, it really depends on what kind of analysis they’re asking you to do, but the rest of this is very reasonable to me and in line with your average take home assignment. I’d expect any work from a senior candidate to meet these guidelines.

The problem is that the actual analysis is probably open-ended and could take an indefinite number hours, and that bullshit favors people with an indefinite amount of free time.","I posted this on another thread here before, but thought I would share my experience with you: 

I made this mistake for a major insurer. Applied, recruiter spoke to me for 5 min to explain the ""practice set"". I spent 30 hours on that damn set. I then didn't even get an interview. They said my AUC was 0.1 too low (my AUC was 0.82, their cutoff was 0.9 I later found out), I missed the cutoff for an interview. I was devastated. Such a massive waste of my time and huge moral killer. Took me a long time to recover from that blow. Now, I flat out refuse unless it's the last step and I really want the position.

My personal advice: lower the bar for the data science on this one and up the bar for the presentation and the clarify.  Seems like they don't need a ML model.  They want a really nice report or dashboard with a clear message.

The challenge is that it takes a significant time investment to develop statistical intuition, domain knowledge, and technical know-how, but he is right to point out that methods seem overemphasized in the field.","Yes -- almost every bad project I've seen has had two primary elements:

1. Analysts starting at machine learning rather than basic statistics and/or rules-based modeling.
2. Failure to understand the data and how it relates to the business problem.

Once you understand the data and the purpose, frankly, 95% of the time the modeling is easy.

I see it as fundamentally a principal-agent problem. Via Occam's razor, the best solution is the simplest one, but the simplest one will almost certainly make the analyst look less smart/cool compared to the AI/ML, Agile and Cloud (insert more buzzwords here) solution.

Same problem when I was in academic economics, so much advanced math and the DSGE models don't forecast anything well.","Yeah, I do. But you have to keep in mind this quote came from someone for whom the methods are easy and this stuff is the hard part.

I’m nearly 20 years in my HR career and I can’t seem to get out of my not-chosen specialty (employee relations.).  I’ve always been interested in HRIS systems and data, but it’s hard to do when you don’t have time and when you don’t work in an org that doesn’t really use human capital data like they should be.    So I have been learning on the side and lurking on this sub for several years.   Two weeks ago I finally decided if I’m going to get out of my current situation I’m going to grad school.  There’s a few grad school programs out there for HR Analytics.  So right now I’m just getting applications together and doing my research.  The program I’m really looking at seriosuly has a technological component to it as well which is important to me.  

There are some jobs where you can make this a career but the HR field is notoriously behind the curve in these ways for way too many reasons not mentioned here.  That’s okay with me.  I am confident I’ll find a job and if it means taking a step back in my career or pay, that’s okay with me.  By the time I graduate I’ll be at an age where I don’t want to work so much anyway.

The responsibilities won’t change much, just the title.","To me, it's better to separate out two distinct things: 

***Data science as a normal job*** is just a rebranding of all those existing quantitative methods that you mentioned.  If you look at DS jobs at banks or insurance companies or logistics firms or CPG, they largely consist of the same data and modeling tasks that have always been done, just with a shiny coat of paint to attract the young un's, maybe with Python and R instead of Matlab or SAS.  They used to be called ""Statisticians"" or ""Quantitative Researchers"" or whatever.  I think this is more or less fine.     

***Data science as a $300k/year job*** is a ZIRP phenomenon.  Sometimes I get the impression that prospective candidates and even gainfully employed data scientists are experiencing this sense of loss, of feeling like they missed out on this gold rush of the last 10 years, when it seemed like growth-crazed tech companies were handing out lucrative offers to anyone with a Kaggle profile and everyone else was forced to up their game to compete.  Not entirely sure it was ever that frothy, but admittedly, the barrier to entry \*was\* lower and the early movers did enjoy some good times.  Who cares if your newly-formed data science team never did anything worth a damn?  Those paychecks kept clearing anyway.

This era is done.  Of course, you can still get a high-paying job.  But it'll be more like becoming a surgeon: specialized training and experience that is only valuable at a small handful of companies.  But for everyone else, ""data science as a normal job"" will still be there, just like GPs are still around and necessary.","This is a very confusing post.  You say Data Science is a fad, but I think you mean the term 'Data Science' is a fad because like you pointed out, there have been other terms used in different times to describe using data, math, and programming to optimize business solutions.

From other comments you left, you mentioned that you are in your 20's and that you seem to be pretty unhappy with your current situation.

Just like most people think they have cancer when they google long enough just to end up being told it's something entirely different and harmless by a physician...
* **Responsibility:** Someone needs to be responsible for the results. That someone also has to be a person that understands what's behind the graph. Just like being able to code in Java helps you with Python in Databricks, because you have an easier time understanding error messages.

The more PRs you review from them, the faster you'll get and the more you'll incorporate what you learn into your code, too).","So here's a few things I can grok just from reading your description.  FWIW, I'm a ""manager"" of software engineering and data science teams.  


1) Your manager brought you on probably because you write code quickly and you're reliable.  When you say you'll do something it gets done and it mostly works.  You probably also don't lie and bullshit about parts of the system you disagree with on principal and are mostly focused on delivering business value.  This is a MASSIVE attribute to have and managers see it as invaluable.  You manager's manager doesn't give a fuck if the software your manager's team wrote is well documented, elegant, or optimized.  All they care about is if it's working, done, and in the clients hands.  


2) Your manager probably feels like they can trust you.  When something is REALLY bad and you say so they know it's actually probably a legit business concern and not just some Poindexter pontificating on the ""what if were as big as Google and this problem took down the whole company"" disaster scenario.  You probably weren't brought on to be ""the guy"" who rips out code and frameworks.  You were brought on to be the adult in the room.  


3) A pattern I notice a lot with your type is that you people define your worth based almost only on your ability to know more than other people.  Then, you compare yourself with other people who know more than you and beat the living shit out of yourself.  However, you never really get to the point of asking yourself ""what about the 90% of people who are actually bad at their jobs, just hanging around hoping they won't get fired, and will never get poached by an old boss?""  There's a lot of those people in industry so chip-up.  Use this as an opportunity to learn from your teammates and be a positive force where you can on the team.  Before long you'll be up to speed.  

3)  I probably shouldn't tell this one... BUT....  Your manager is going to feel like a real dipshit if he goes to his boss and says ""uhhh, remember that guy I said was great and that we hired???  Well he sucks and now I need to justify cutting him"".  Not that it isn't possible if there's a layoff, but he looks like a doofus with bad judgement if he has to fire the dude he just subverted the recruiting process to bring on the team.

2) If he wants you guys to train other people, that is fine but then your work needs to move to make space for that. If he is insisting that everything still be completed on time I would push back and ask for a priority list. Basically make him choose. Document his choice too! 
3) It sounds like you know a lot more than him about your jobs. He will probably make unreasonable requests at some point, in that situation try not to get angry, just calmly push back and explain what is realistic and what is not.

04-02-2023,293,"Expectations for Data Scientists, a very interesting perspective","The author's issues really come down to advice often given by those answering questions in the weekly thread for what to look for in the first role. Look for an organization where data science is part of the main product. Try to find companies that have the tech stack that you want to work in. Use glassdoor or ask entry level employees at the firms you are targeting about the early career mentoring experience. 

We see similar threads on the disappointment of early career on this board as well. If you are data scientist number one with no IT support, maybe even no management support, you are going to have a bad time.","Some important points to consider, especially now that there are young people getting into the field as their first job, rather than the old physicist/economist/etc turning into data scientists. For those doing a bachelors degree in data science, and are entering this field as their first profession, it would be helpful to have a clear expectation of what the job is like.

However, I think the opinions in the blogpost is misleading... and here is why:


**Re: Master of all trades, jack of none.**

There was an old saying about how data scientists are people who know more about computer science than statisticians, and know more about statistics than computer scientists. While this statement probably served the early data scientists, I think it may oversimplify the expectations somewhat.

Most universities teach statistics with many electives in computing, and many computer science degree comes with statistics units as well. Most graduates wanting to be a data scientist come with both. To stand out, a data scientist needs to know equivalent statistics as a statistician, and have equivalent computing skills as a computer scientist. The famous Venn diagram should now consider the union, rather than the intersection.

And yes, in my career so far, Excel, SQL, Tableau, PowerBI, Python, R, Scala, Java, C#, JavaScript/TypeScript, Julia - were all ""used"". Though I must admit that I wad only an ""expert"" (better than others in the company) in Python, R, and Excel. I still had to fix SQL and other dashboards developed by others - so I guess I still had to know as much SQL as the data engineers in the organisation. Econometric analysis of time series for economics teams, developing serverless APIs on the cloud, developing ETL/ELT pipelines, designing OLAP databases, conducting Bayesian survival analysis, designing a custom interactive visualisation using JavaScript, estimating driving distances between sets of millions of different postcodes, natural language processing, facilitaing workshops to develop data strategies, teaching data analysts how to use R, identifying why two PowerBI dashboards were showing different numbers, optimising a SQL query that was clogging up the data warehouse, ... there was no limit to the range of tasks.

In each of those roles, we are expected to be as much of an expert as the previous person who was supposedly an ""expert"". We're brought in because there is an issue. Which means that the expectation is that we can understand and fix whatever the expert had done. I could go on forever with these tasks that are seemingly outside the duties of a data scientist. I hope that some day I data scientists can be specialised to just one set of tasks. But if everything else in the domain of data was functioning, I wouldn't need to be called upon to fix things. So I need to dabble in tasks other than exploring data and modelling.


**Re: No or inadequate data infrastructure.**

Just going by the description in the post, I am going to assume that the author never actually got to be a data scientist. Unfortunate, that he had to give up before even getting a taste of what it would have been like. Google Drive and SharePoint? Don't tell me all the analysis was done in Excel and PowerPoint... I would have asked during the interview what their tech stack is.


**Re: Expectations vs reality of being a data scientist.**

Of course the cleaning of data is a regular part of the job. Same goes with physcists, chemists, biologists, etc. who need to painstakingly conduct experiments. Meticulously cleaning and maintaining all equipments. Data collection can take weeks, months, and even years. Analysis and modelling maybe takes days. I know because I used to be a chemist/physicist.

If you want clean tabular data just handed to you, you should become an econometrician or a political scientist - other people will do all the data collection for you, and more often than not, clean it for you too. I know because I had to fulfill these data requests for them. (sometimes do the analysis too - because Stata couldn't handle a million rows of data)


**Re: Customer service agents**

Data science is a non-essential, enabling job - not the core business. We are always servicing our clients or stakeholders. Management need to manage workloads and priorities. This balancing act is similar in other areas. Positive takeaway is that data specialists are always needed, one way or another.


**Re: Isolation and monotony**

This point, again, applies to many jobs - especially since the pandemic. Meaningful relationships are hard to forge. If it is of any positive - it makes it easier to hop to another job if a better opportunity comes by.


**Re: Lack of guidance from senior data scientists and domain experts**

Lack of guidance is unfortunate, and I have experienced this too. But I would consider this as a plus in retrospect. With this freedom, you could forge your own path, and be able to follow (via the internet) who you consider to be great data scientists.

At least in the ""early days"" of the ""boom"" there weren't many ""seniors"" that one could learn from. More bluntly, I would consider most seniors to be incompetent at worst, and not-really-someone-I-should-learn-from at best. This relates to the first point about being a unicorn. If you don't have a unicorn senior data scientist, you can't learn to be a unicorn data scientist from them.


**Re: Politics**

Your job isn't to ragequit tho, it's to find a way to extract some value from it. This might mean controlling for the confounders you suspect are contributing to the bias.

The joke here is that linear algebra is this massively important and rich field, and it's impossible to right a single book that covers everything. With that being said, mathematicians have their personal favorite linear algebra books, and anything that isn't covered will just get looked up somewhere else.

Which brings me to the topic at hand: reading math like you can read English.  There are so many tricks that I can't list them, but I can assure you there *are* tricks that help with understanding things.  For example, if you see *e* in an equation, that tells me right away that there is some sort of growth happening somewhere.  If I see *e* and *i* (the imaginary number) in an equation, it tells me that growth is oscillating.  If I see a factorial (!) in an equation, that tells me that something, somewhere, at some point, was being counted, so this formula tells me how many of something there is.  

I would be happy to talk further if you ever have any specific questions about things you run into.  

Two last points: Euler is one of the most important figures ever in the history of math.  If we named everything that Euler did after him, there would be mass confusion, but just trust that almost all math you ever see outside of Greek geometry or Middle Eastern algebra probably went through Euler.  There is an Euler society, and I have a tattoo of his portrait. Last, all math was figured out by someone at some point.  None of it was divinely inherited.  Some of those people were popular enough that whatever they decided to call something stuck.  Because of that, there can be some unusual terms you run into, and sometimes the original motivation is lost.","YouTube 3blue1brown

Thank me later","> I would like to understand them, not just learn how to use and apply the formulas

Then you pretty much need to study a math degree. Not necessarily in a university setting, but a “math degree” in the sense of following the usual curriculum, and in the sense of doing lots and lots exercises, without skipping any step until the current one is solidly mastered. 

To get an even deeper understanding, you’d need to do what every math major does for breakfast: proving theorems. 

And if you go to an actual classroom setting, you have the extra benefit of getting feedback on your progress, because while self-studying we tend to overestimate how much we’ve mastered a new topic.

But yeah, the most important things are to start from the basics and start building the pyramid from there, and lots of practice.

- In your data career you will make a WHOLE lot of mistakes. It's not a matter of ""if"", but ""when"" and ""how"". You'll make these mistakes and will be held accountable for them and, in most of the cases, get scolded accordingly but nothing more than it. It's part of the game and it's OK;

- Note that many (if not most) of the mistakes happen because of management or context-related issues: a badly made requirement, untrustworthy data sources, business contexts that change every other minute, clueless managers... You will not be able to deliver good reports if, for example, you are burdened with lots of things to do and worry about;

- As somebody pointed out previously, chances are your data, for good or for bad, will be forgotten after half an hour;

- If your data delivering activity is THAT business critical, you should not be the only person to be held accountable for it. In case there's a gross mistake, your manager should be blamed for 1) not building a mistake-prone process of generating the information 2) leaving this duty solely in the hands of a data analyst, as there should be at least a peer reviewer;

04-06-2023,246,How to level up my software engineering skills as a Data Scientist ?,"Books + code reviews.

Robust Python is an amazing read, you should start here. You can follow it up with fluent Python (very long) and other things such as pragmatic programmer, architecture patterns with python, ..

Main tip I can give you is that writing clean Python is harder than say Java imo. The spec of Java forces you into a specific way of thinking. Python being multi-paradigm lets you do whatever you want, it can be a class, a dataclass, tuple, namedtuple, dict, typedDict, ... My advice: occam's razzor. You can read non-Python design patterns-esque books but you need to be aware that their implementation in dynamically typed languages might be simpler.

Have people read your code as well. Could be your colleagues, could be people on the internet.","In general, junior programmers are mostly focused on solving a problem. Senior programmers are focused on solving problems as well. But they're also concerned with issues of design. E.g. how to design and build a high quality, robust system that's easy to read, easy to refactor, easy to enhance, easy to test, easy to identify bugs, etc.

As someone who identifies as a programmer and mostly works as one, you're likely not expected to produce code at that level of quality. Here are some things your team would probably appreciate however:

* Try to make your code modular and break it down into multiple functions. One main function calling three sub functions (e.g. `func1()`,`func2()`, etc.) is better than one main function with all of the code in it.

* Related to this point, try to adhere to the single responsibility principle. One function should have one single thing that it does. If you find that your functions are doing multiple things, break those down into their own separate functions.

* Use type hints and docstrings in your functions

* Use descriptive and thoughtful names for functions and variables. If you have a function that calculates the seconds in a day, it may be a good idea to call that function something like `def GetSecondsInADay():` or something similar. The idea is that you want these names to assist in being self-documenting as much as possible.

* If you copy and paste code from the internet, try to understand what it's doing. And if it's inconsistent with the rest of the code in the function, try to update it so that it's consistent and matches the rest of the function.

* If you're faced with a choice between slower but more readable code, or slightly faster but more clever code, go with the more readable choice. If performance later becomes an issue it can be updated later.

* Have a consistent style for writing programming. See if a style guide exists at your organization for writing code. If so, adopt that style.

* (This may be the most important) If you are aware of inefficiencies in the code, or especially bugs, communicate them to someone more skilled on your team or another team. Even if you can't fix them, they may be able to. Or they may be able to help you fix them. Do not just ship code with problems in it if someone is available that can help you fix them if you let them know about it.

Doing all of those things would be really helpful and I think your team would appreciate them. You can also ask them specifically if they have any recommendations about how to write your code.","Does your company not do code reviews? IMO that’s the best way to increase your skills. Having people tell you do this, not this, and practicing that is really effective. Hard to level up skills w/o that."

Are these good reasons? Obviously (I guess) the sample mean is an unbiased estimator of the population mean. & any operator fulfilling certain conditions is linear...

Surely a major reason to use the mean is that in situations where a KPI (esp for a skewed distributions) involves summing a sample from the distribution (eg total sales or costs of an item) the mean will reflect that much better (because the calculation duplicates the one for the KPI).",the reason is that if you have a lot of data computing the mean is super cheap while computing the median is extremely expensive because you have to keep every single data point in memory.,"I prefer the harmonic mean, personally."

25-08-2023,245,"i got accepted in a data officer job, and i don't know what the hell i'm doing","Your main task as a data officer is not ""analyze data"", but think about where, when, by whom, in which quality, which type of data is needed. To answer these questions you have to know what the business strategy is. For example, if the business strategy tells you that the company must absolutely expand to China, then you have to dig into data protection laws from China to understand where you are allowed to store data. If those laws tell you that data must never leave China, then you will have to think about where and how to store the data in a Chinese data center.

In this manner you derive a data strategy from the overall business and technology/IT/analytics strategy. The data strategy should tell you what to do about data on a more general level. From this you then derive the tactical actions to implement. For example, if they are using Salesforce and you need to combine the data in a data warehouse, then you need to create ETL jobs that get the data out of Salesforce into the data warehouse. You should think about amount of data, accuracy of data, timeliness of data, consumption and distribution of data etc.

Then you (or your team) executes on that. If you are asked to do analytics on the data, then you need to think how to obtain the data in the first place. How to create dashboards, where and how to store them, how to control access rights, and so on, and so on.

Just some pointers.

What good would a PhD do for you? Besides that fact that PhDs aren't really like really likes masters degrees and you don't really just casually go back to school to get it, it will offer no value unless you're looking to get into something like algorithm development and do bleeding edge work. I just really question the value for anyone with your resume. And I'm saying this as a STEM PhD working in DS. I promise you, people don't care _that_ much about it over a masters degree. Even then, the only thing it does for you is get you into that first interview/phone screen. Once they're talking to you, it's all about how well you sell yourself.

If you're not getting past phone screens/first round interviews with the resume you report here, then you need to work on your interview skills, because your resume sounds like most recruiters' wet dream. That's okay- it's a skill unto itself and I've really only found that just doing more interviews has helped. Take interviews with any place you think might even remotely be worthwhile. Not just big names. I'm not exactly advocating wasting anyone's time with a position you could _never_ see yourself taking, but don't be overly selective, either. The main goal is to improve your interview skills and if you happen to find a good fit then all the better.","You should not do a PhD just in the hopes of making it easier to get a data science job.

my main piece of advice relating to adhd: just like in academia, the field of data science can reward/reinforce a lot of behaviors (hyperfocus, perfectionism) that help your career while also dragging down the rest of your life. 

you can artificially patch over a lot of problems by convincing yourself that once you’re done with the next project/model/technique you’ll take care of the things you’ve put on the backburner (exercise, dentist, meals, hobbies…). it can work for awhile, especially when you’re getting external validation from professors/managers, but hyper focus comes at a cost.

for me, getting medicated and educated on the subject has been helpful for understanding my own behavior and making some lifestyle adjustments to improve.","I have adhd and have been struggling with trying to get my Data Science degree the past few years.

22-06-2023,235,Why is it so common to use average/mean instead of median when most datasets are skewed and not evenly distributed?,"From a data engineer's perspective, average is much easier to compute than median for large datasets.

To calculate an average for a long list of values, all you need is a sum and a total. The database can read each value once, add it to the sum, then release it from memory and move on. For a median however, you need to sort all the values and find the value in the middle, which requires more compute time and memory. There are a few algorithms that improve this but none of them scale very well.

None of this matters if you only have 100 or 1,000 values, or if you're doing one-time calculations. But for us, our data analysts ask us to produce reports from tables with millions of records, with live dashboards that constantly get updated. So unless there's a really good reason to use a median instead of a mean, we'll go with the mean.",The average is often more useful for business problems as people understand it and it links to the total value and many problems aren't skewed although some certainly are.,"It depends on what you're trying to project.

Here's a very real example:

Say you have orders that come in, and you have a projection of the number of orders that will be placed next month.

Now, there are two questions you may have:

1. How many items/units does the typical order have? You may want to know this because it can impact how you design your ordering system, how you design processes for approvals, etc. In this case, the median will be most helpful - you don't want to design for the tail of the distribution.
2. How many total units should I expect? You may want to know this to project sales, total units, for planning, manufacturing, etc. In this case, you want the average - you do not want to take out the tail of the distribution because that would systematically underestimate your numbers."

The jobs you are applying for today didn't exist five years ago.

What isn't reported is that because of the hype around DS as a dream job, there is now an enormous glut of entry level workers in the field. For the open DS roles we need a lot of people with five to ten years experience. That's a mismatch. With the right managerial approach a new grad can be brought into an organization and do well, but for the most part the field and the skill level are a poor match."

I'd argue that some mix of CS + Stats + math-econ is likely the best set of degrees for DS but from what I've seen, DS undergrad degrees from reputable schools like like a hybrid of those. Which is a lot more tractable than trying to triple major.

For what it's worth the undergrad university (if you're doing data science there's a near 100% chance you've heard of it) I went to now has a DS program. It looks like better preparation than what I actually did as a Math-econ major with a minor in statistics.

When you’re working with data there are long periods where focus is on the data plumbing (like etl work and other backend stuff). This drives executives nuts as they don’t see direct results for long periods and assume nothing is getting done. It sucks, but it’s the reality. 

The trick is design your work so you have a steady trickle of short term “visible” results while you get the heavier lifting done in the background. Push out a simple report, give them an early insight anything that is tangible.

For them, the best model is the one that is already available when needed.  


If you want to make use of your math skills perhaps you can try your hands on what Machine Learning engineers at the fore front are currently doing.","Having an intuition for the underlying math is helpful when you’re designing complex neural nets from scratch, particularly when you need to pick loss functions. Being able to visualize the geometries you’re defining can help you skip some dead ends. Occasionally you can also use that intuition to design networks that are guaranteed to have specific properties without any training, and that can massively improve your results in some cases."

It’s not AI, but more focused on making sense of new massive data availability. Think agricultural modeling using satellite imagery, disaster detection.  Lots of cool shit happening outside of tech.

Data science exists, partly, because of “big data” (sorry), and obviously data isn’t going anywhere.","The ""entire job market"" is not down, beware of the bias. It's just the tech bubble which burst after some big players decided to initiate a period of layoffs.

24-02-2023,213,How difficult is it to get into Sports Analytics?,The pay is shit,"+1 to the comments regarding it being difficult to break in and the compensation generally being lower than other industries. 

I wanted to hop in and provide a response geared towards “okay, I get that but I’m still interested, how do I get noticed?” . FWIW, I do not work in sports analytics, but am active in the public facing sports analytics space and because of that have some thoughts that I feel to be relevant and helpful. 

- start building up an online presence. There’s a healthy online sports analytics community on Twitter, here on Reddit, and in other places. It gives you the platform to share your work and insights. 

- feeding off point 1, I’d recommend starting small but then finding an area that hasn’t been fully explored or perhaps is lacking public facing work. Nothing wrong with not reinventing the wheel to get the hang of things but if you want to be noticed, then it is advantageous to find a niche. You’d be surprised that this often times doesn’t require the most advanced techniques/methods. 

- participate in contests. Big Data Bowl winners and honorable mentions have been using that as a means of getting jobs with teams/adjacent to the industry. It’s not just football either. There is a hockey competition (Big Data Cup) and there recently was a horse racing one. There are more for those still in school, but regardless there are opportunities to get your hands on data and try to answer some difficult questions. 

- attend conferences. Some are less expensive and not as predatory (Sloan is very expensive, but Carnegie Melon’s is not…for example). Heck, you can even try to get a project accepted for a presentation (SABR Analytics is a good example). 

- network. Pretty self explanatory! 

Hope this helps!","This is anecdotal from my graduating class even before COVID lockdowns.

Sports analytics (for big teams) is extremely saturated because of how few positions there are. You'll get hundreds/thousands of applicants for DA/DS roles for big sports companies. And those companies pay very little for highly qualified individuals. We're talking $40-50k/yr for someone with an MS or PhD, and that's if you get in. When you hit senior levels, you're looking at closer to $90k-120k but I haven't personally met anyone at that level.

09-04-2023,206,Bouncing back after a bad work experience as a data scientist in an organization,"Some places are toxic. If the feedback was not constructive, then they were negative to be negative. Taking time off is probably a good plan, so that you clear your head. I worked at a toxic place and it took me a while after I left to realize how toxic it was and how they considered some things normal that were not normal at all.","You've got your priorities straight. Don't worry, there are shitty jobs everywhere, and you will feel even better once some time has passed and you realize you aren't defined by that one experience. 

Bouncing back is probably easier than you think. I wouldn't even describe it as a setback that way -- more that you've just gained some new wisdom from that experience and you are shifting directions. A large number of people persist in shitty jobs and that isn't ""success"" by my metrics. 

My personal experience is I quit a job as a contract data scientist at a toxic company and it was one of the best decisions I could have made for my career. Contractors were exploited and rarely converted to full time, and projects were scrapped left and right. I was so burned out that I knew I would have been PIP'd/fired if I had tried to endure it, so I left, took ~18 months to take care of a sick family member, organized my thoughts, and used the experience to recalibrate my goals. I went back on the job market and eventually landed a great senior data scientist position in my original field (biotech) with full time benefits, a title increase, and a pay raise. I felt more certain about my goals and am very content with the outcome.

16-04-2023,205,Any American data scientists or ML engineers here ever work abroad? What was the data science scene and job market like in your new host country?,"US citizen working in Spain. Disclaimer to say obviously you’ll need perspectives from different countries to get a clear idea.

First, I would recommend trying to find a remote US job. If you have that and permission to move here then you are in great shape. Another option is just to quit and take a year off, assuming you make good money, then come back. You’ll still earn nearly the same $$ over 2 years of working here but it’s obv more of a career risk.

I say this because if you come to mainland Europe and work for a European company, it won’t just be a pay cut, your salary could be more like half of what it was. Getting a job is far tougher than the US because you’ll need someone to sponsor your visa, and the company will legally need demonstrate they tried to hire an EU citizen first (who will gladly accept the lower salary). Not only that but the company will ofc need to be working in English (which is common), but all else equal preference will still go to those who can speak the local language, and job apps often have language requirements too. 

Assuming you can land a good job — the taxes are way higher and you’ll have to deal with US taxes on top of that. The cost of living in a major city really isn’t much cheaper than the US (excl. NYC, SF). I would say the “office culture” and work/life is pretty much the same - besides being blissfully removed from US politics/culture and everyone around you hailing from Europe, ofc. 

If you can allow yourself to get past all that, it’s wonderful to be in Europe and be able to travel anywhere on weekends. You’ll probably get 25-30 days of vacation and healthcare is free/cheaper (I still need to pay for private insurance but not nearly as much). That said I use much of my vacation just to visit my family/friends back in the US. If you are in your late twenties like me, you’ll have to contend with missing weddings/bachelor parties/US trips with friends. Flying across the Atlantic for a quick trip really sucks ($$$, time, jet lag). But your friends/family will want to visit you too. It evens out a bit. 

Again, I’m doing it and have a really nice life, but at least once a week I think about how much I miss my friends and could be earning 2-3x with the same job in the US. 

If/when I come back to the US I’ll have great intangible life experience, a nice european social circle, lots of bucket list checks, and proficiency in the Spanish language. In the short run will not be able to catch up financially with those who never left, to me that isn’t as important though. 

It’s one thing to daydream about doing it during a slow day at the office and another to follow through with it. Unless you’re lucky it’s not simple — but it is very rewarding if you’re looking for a major life shake up.","I'm an American Expat now living in Amsterdam working as an MLE (but my role also overlaps with DS because I know more statistics and modeling than any of the other data people). I'd say my pay here is about 70-80% of the US but as others have pointed out you make a lot of that up with competent social services and not living in a car dependant city. Housing in Amsterdam is quite expensive but still cheaper than the bay area. The biggest difference in work culture is there isn't this expectation of being always online, taking your work home, or working yourself to death. I don't feel the need to be constantly monitoring my phone and I get a ton of vacation days per year. The work culture is more chill for sure.

Amsterdam is nice because the Netherlands has the highest English fluency mainland Europe. My company is 50% Dutch and 50% people from all over the world. My onboarding team was 2 French, 1 Turkish, 1 Albanian, and a Brit. My direct coworker are from Spain, Belgium, Argentina, India, Russia, and the rest are Dutch. I love the international feel and the diversity, but as one might expect, the company is still very ""European."" 

One of the big pluses of the Netherlands is the 30% rule. Basically, if you qualify you can get the first 30% of your income untaxed, which in the Netherlands is huge as the taxes here are quite high. You can get the 30% rule for up to 5 years, after which you need to pay taxes as usual. But I'll almost certainly stay after the 30% rule is over because living here is amazing. I bike to work every day though a beautiful city and the people here are kind and open. I've lived in Seattle, San Francisco, and other parts of Europe but Amsterdam is my favorite for sure. 

Finding housing is a huge challenge and doing it remotely is next to impossible. But once you clear that hurdle getting setup here is easier than most international cities.","I’m an American working in the UK. It was great until I got laid off while on a work visa. If you come to the UK, come on a global talent visa — I’m applying for it right now and fingers crossed that I get it, but I’m not exaggerating when I say this is the single most stressful thing that’s ever happened to me. 

Also, you will take a massive pay cut, there’s no two ways about it. You might think it’s worth it, and I was very happy with my pay, but some of the companies I’m interviewing with are paying in the £60s for senior level data science (and I’m desperate enough to take a huge pay cut due to the work visa situation). Even my very well paid senior level job topped out at 100k all in (including stock).

Finally, don’t underestimate the difficulty of leaving a life that you’ve built abroad. I too thought that I would just be in Europe for a year, maybe 2, but once you starting building a life especially when you’re in your mid to late 20s or early 30s, when you’re meeting your life partner, thinking about settling down, etc., it’s hard to leave that. I would 10000% recommend working abroad and the pay cut is definitely worth it for a few years, but you might find yourself in a situation where it’s pick between much lower pay and a life you’ve built and much higher pay and a return back to the USA that you’re not sure you want (my current situation). I would still do it all again, just a word of warning."
04-04-2023,203,Am I kidding myself to think that this is doable?,"Here's my advice as someone who learned machine learning on the job:

Pick a real project, and work through it. 

This isn't school - you don't need to learn everything in a building-block kinda way. I know it's tempting - you probably want an entire course on the entire world of machine learning, where you learn every machine learning model, why they work, etc..

But you don't need that. Instead, focus on what you're trying to solve. Find a problem at your company that seems worthwhile (i.e., has monetary value) and feasible (i.e., you can imagine that the data that you have has the anser somewhere in there).

And then get cracking. Go look online to see how other people have solved that problem or similar problems, and then do that. 

What will be helpful is to start at the end and then work backwards: what should your project produce? A dashboard? An engine? A data dump? A single number? A decision?

Work through that, and then start working backwards until you can sketch out what all you need to do to get there, and then start tackling these items 1 by 1 until you get to the end.

Major piece of advice: it's not going to be linear, so be ready to ask questions of your business partners, go back online to find more answers, etc.","Don't discourage yourself. You are an excellent candidate to become a top-tier data scientist. Data science is still a relatively new field, and data scientists can and have come from diverse backgrounds and fields.

01-01-2023,199,How can you become a senior data scientist if there are no jobs for juniors,"It’s a confluence of a couple factors. 

1.	Some may disagree, but in my opinion data science itself really isn’t an entry/junior level role. Domain knowledge is very important and can take years to develop. Quite a few data scientists start their careers as data/reporting analysts or some other career that is tangentially related to data. 
2.	Industry labor supply. There are a ton of entry level candidates applying for a limited pool of entry level positions. Consequently these roles get filled very quickly. At the senior level it can take time to find the right candidate, hence these positions tend to go unfilled for longer and you have a higher chance of seeing them when looking.
3.	Title creep/non-standardized titles. One companies senior data scientist may be another’s data analyst. 

My advice: if you’re serious about pursuing a role in data science find a data-adjacent role where you can apply data science principles and build experience that way.",">i legit have 0 passion and i love nothing in the workfield

You will not be a good data scientist. Be a Data engineer, they're crazy important.","Degree inflation has hit DS hard. I think these days it’s quite hard to become a DS without at least a masters if not a PhD. What really differentiates people as data scientists vs analysts is the ability to combine ML, stats, and in many cases experimental design in ways that are mostly learned in advanced coursework so there’s some justification for that, but a lot of it is just wanting credentials to justify high salaries. So it’s going to be hard to break in as an undergrad. That said, software engineers at tech firms make comparable if not better money than data scientists controlling for education and experience, so I’d probably just shoot for that with a CS background."
24-06-2023,200,People who use python for data science - what are the use cases for building your own classes?,"I work in drug design.  We've built up a whole library for representing chemical structures and chemical complexes with their own class methods, attributes, etc.  A lot revolves around inheritance.  Similarly, when building ML models, we reuse a lot of the same infrastructure, which has been abstracted into OOP.","Basically anytime you expect to have generic repeatable logic that can be used across projects and there isn’t any existing Python library for you to use, you should build out custom functions, custom classes or if necessary your own custom packages. Common cleaning functions or something domain specific that needs to be captured to add agility to future projects are good justifications for this type of thing. 

At my work, we’ve written custom classes for PySpark code to help simplify our data pipelines on Azure. Some steps that leverage Microsoft’s SDK are used across projects so tying these things together really makes a world of difference for our team. For example, mssparkutils is called when we’re accessing various data lake containers but this initial setup step applies every time we’re reading data, so there’s no reason to rewrite that code across projects. Instead, we’ve written code to handle this process against any of our data lake’s containers.","They’re particularly good for encapsulation. When constructed correctly, you can hide a tremendous amount of complexity behind a simple set of methods and trust it to maintain its own crud internally without you babysitting the logic. That in turn lets you code from the perspective of, “I don’t care how it does the job as long as it’s doing the job it says it does.”

As an example, suppose you have a purely functional-style implementation of a pseudorandom number generator, no OOP whatsoever. Your PRNG necessarily has an initial state and some parameters to determine its next state. In a purely functional implementation, you’d then have gen_next_double(state, params) as your function for getting the next result. But… in order for it to work correctly, gen_next_double() would also need to return the next state. So you’d have to code it as “r_val, next_state = gen_next_double(curr_state, params)”. And every single time you called that function, you’d have to make sure you correctly passed in the previous state lest you repeat a subsequence and undermine the pseudorandomness. That’s a lot of work just to grab a random number, and you’d almost certainly make a mistake if your code was even the least bit technical. May god have mercy on your soul if you’ve never worked with PRNG states before, and you’d better not need parallelism.

Enter OOP. Define a RandomNumberGenerator class with attributes curr_state and params. Then you can give it a method .gen_next_double() that knows to grab curr_state and params; and then automatically updates curr_state at the end. Then all you have to do is provide an initial state and the params one singular time, and let the class handle all the bookkeeping for you. If someone comes along who doesn’t know a thing about state machines, that’s okay. The class handles it for them, so they don’t have to worry about repeated sequences and such because the class handles that internally."

Person 1 should be in the clear if he manifested his position clearly."
02-02-2023,197,Are ML masters cash grabs by the uni? How do I evaluate how good the masters programs are?,"As someone who attended a master's program at a prestigious university that was super expensive and had a mediocre masters’ curriculum, here's my advice.

First of all, it's tricky to define a ""good"" master's program.  If the program has a good curriculum and good alumni placement, then it's good.  However, if the program teaches almost nothing, gives you a really expensive piece of paper, and has good alumni placement, is it ""good"" because of the outcomes even though the actual program itself sucks?  My master's program was in the latter category.  I learned almost nothing that I didn't know already, but found a high-paying job after graduation that I would not have been able to get without a master's with that university's name on the degree.  If you're debating between a less prestigious program with a great curriculum and a more prestigious program with a bad curriculum, then it's up to you to figure out which best fits your goals.

Additionally, the quality of a master’s program is often independent of the quality of the department as a whole.  My graduate department regularly put out world-class research with professors who are very famous, but only the PhD students got to learn from them.  The master’s program was much less rigorous and totally isolated from what the PhD students were doing.

I highly recommend looking at what alumni are doing on LinkedIn.  Don't be afraid to contact them and ask to set up a quick phone call to discuss the program.  If the program is really good or really bad, you'll find people willing to tell you about it.

**Things you should look up in general**

* Does the program publish employment statistics?  Do alumni have jobs that you're interested in?

* How much is the program?  If it'll put you $100K+ in debt without any chance of financial assistance, it's almost certainly a cash grab program.

* How many master's students graduate each year?  If it's a huge number (like 300+), then it's probably a cash grab.  For reference, NC State is a well-respected statistics institution.  They typically have around 200 total grad students.

* Is the program taught by tenure-track or tenured faculty, or is it taught mostly by lecturers or industry people?  This is important even if the department has a lot of well-known professors because you might not get to interact with them.

* Do you get to take electives, or is it a cohort where you and your fellow grad students all take the same courses?  If you don't get to mix with the PhD students then it's probably a cash cow.

* Does the program offer a thesis option?  If it does, then it's less likely to be a cash cow program.

* Is the program at NYU or Columbia?  Those two are notorious for extremely expensive cash cow masters programs.

**Things to look for when snooping on LinkedIn:**

* What kinds of work are alumni doing according to their LinkedIn profiles?  Does the work look like it pays well?  Was their first job out of the program close to the university, or are jobs more geographically spread out?  If alumni are spread out, then that indicates that the university is well-respected outside of its immediate location.  However, this might not be an issue if you want to stay in the area of the university.

* How does the above vary based on *undergrad* experience?  For example, are people who went to lesser-known undergrad universities working jobs that are clearly worse than people who went to better universities?  This is important because if this is the case, then it's an indication that the program might not actually be teaching much, in which case alumni are being placed based on where they were when they entered the program, rather than because the program actually teaches anything good.  My program definitely had worse placement for people with non-traditional backgrounds compared to those with stronger quantitative experience.

* What does career trajectory for experienced alumni (like 5+ years) look like?  Are they moving to more senior roles, or are they moving around from company to company without any obvious increase in responsibility?


**Things to ask alumni**

I emphasize *alumni*, rather than current students, because they actually finished the program and know whether or not it helped them.  They also have no more ties to the university and can speak more candidly.  (Dropouts are fine too.)

* Who was your advisor, and how were they to work with?  If the advisor was a micromanager or shitty, I guarantee you will hear about it.  Also, note that even if a professor is a good lecturer, they can still be a terrible advisor.  My advisor was very well-liked by students who took courses with him and talked to him around the department and even won many teaching awards.  However, as an advisor, he dictated every part of my capstone project and didn't allow me to have any input into it.

* Are professors generally friendly and approachable?  In some departments, professors leave their office doors open and schmooze with their students.  In others, professors constantly act like they've above students in every way and clearly respect PhD students more than master's students, and may or may not respect masters students more than undergrads.  Outside of machine learning I've heard of people deciding not apply to UChicago's Economics PhD program because while it's the most prestigious department in economics, it's dominated by pompous assholes.

* How was university career services?  For reference, I found my first job out of grad school through a posting on my university's internal job board after their career services helped me understand what resources they had.  Additionally, some universities have recruiters at companies that focus entirely on recruiting students from that particular university.

* In hindsight, would you have done this program, or would you have done something else?","I had a candidate (fresh out of a top-tier Uni's new DS masters program) literally excuse themselves from my interview process citing they ""didn't feel equipped"".

This stage of my interview is very basic - just looking to see if somebody can do a simple analysis in python (not even any real ML).

I genuinely felt bad for the candidate. So I reached out to the head of the DS program at the school and extremely overly politely offered to see if there was any guidance I could provide to mitigate a situation where somebody who graduated 3.8 would feel they were not equipped to even TRY an interview.

I started out just using Udemy classes to teach myself Python and making up my own data projects like tracking my frequent headaches to see if I could find a cause.

I have found that obtaining a base level amount of knowledge and displaying a growth mindset and willingness to learn goes a long way!,"A statistics oriented degree in economics is the opposite of being self taught, that's one of the most common ways to become a data scientist.

Degrees in data science itself aren't needed, and to be honest most employers prefer people with traditional backgrounds because theres a lot of crap DS programs out there. Econ isn't as direct as a degree in stats but as long as you take some programming courses while in college you'll be qualified for data analyst roles, and if you get a MS in something highly technical you can get data scientist roles."

ChatGPT will revolutionize things, domain knowledge will save you.","I've been in a \_similar\_ position to you as before. Here's my thought process; I hope it helps!

\> Currently work as a Data Science Tech Lead in an Insurance AI lab with 20+ data scientist. Overlooking 3 squads, coaching senior DS & maintaining technical quality. The lab mainly do NLP research & projects are interesting.

That's awesome! Definitely make sure you give yourself some credit for being able to push yourself to grow, learn new skills, and take on more ownership & responsibility. It's hard to do and doesn't come easy for most people.

\> The higher the career ladder, the fewer chance for me to actually write code & touch the data

There's many ways to think about this:

1. Is it possible that you miss writing code and touching the data **because you're really really good at it?** We like doing things that we're really good at! This explains why the average chess player or esports video game player never becomes pro. They found their passion playing matches in their comfort zone, but they dislike doing deliberate practice on their weaknesses because it's uncomfortable.
2. Is it possible that once you become just as competent and comfortable being a leader, **that you would enjoy it just as much**? The characteristics of being an IC vs a leader are very different, absolutely. For the most part, you can forget about deep work and spending weeks reading papers. But leading teams is also very fulfilling in it's own way.
3. In some sense, ""moving up the chain of command"" by definition means that you aren't a grunt in the army anymore firing weapons but instead leading and helping the infantry make the right decisions. If the details are **down** in the weeds, then you are **up** above scouring the map. Your former in-the-weeds knowledge is still important because that's how you build trust with the folks in the weeds. No engineer likes reporting to someone who never coded (or who at least doesn't respect engineers).

\> Data Scientist is never (really) the bread & butter of a company. Yes we can build ML model that generate business value, but rarely the core business.

In most companies, this rings true. If you want to play with math and algorithms, then your best bet is to work in an academic or industry lab. That's a different set of tradeoffs of course.

Analytics, aka counting stuff reliably for a business, can be incredibly rewarding if you have the right mindset and outlook. If reading fun ML papers is the main goal, then there's maybe only a few hundred roles in industry where you really get to do this and those are competitive. And as you pointed out, ML plays a small role in business in general.

\> That also means up to certain level, the only way up is to manage people & focus on the business side.

This doesn't align with my own experience. There are many ways to add value to the world here:

1. You could help companies build their data science strategy as a consultant. You have to work with stakeholders but may not have to manage a large team of people.
2. You could create educational content on how teams should think about data science and ML.
3. You could build your own product where DS / ML are at the core. Lean on your hybrid IC and management background

\> The coming trend of LLM is worrying too (for all DS working in NLP)

Meh. LLM's are neat for sure. But just like Google search empowered everyone to be more productive, so will LLM's. Nearly every time X technology is supposed to replace / reduce the need for Y skill / job, **it never pans out that way because you can't predict in advance how the structure of the work and the organization will change**.

A simple example -- Instagram was acquired for $1 billion by Facebook and had a team of less than 20 people. If you wanted to build Instagram in 2001 or 2005, you would have needed thousands of people. You would have had to make mobile data work, build your own phone, mobile phone operating system, and so much more. Apple, the cell phone providers, and thousands of companies ""automated"" / replaced the need for every company to tackle every single part of the problem in-house. Similarly, AWS didn't eliminate the need for DevOps engineers / SysAdmins, it created a world where even small teams can punch above their weight class.

LLM's will help thousands of smaller teams get more done and punch above their weight class. Just like Google Search meant that every employee in a company didn't have to ask an assistant to go down to the library to look up ""the names of Abraham Lincoln's kids""

**Lastly -- I will end with some links that informed my outlook on work.**

&#x200B;

My personal TL;DR:

\- Work is hard. If you want to get paid well, you have to do things that most people don't want to do. Everyone loves analyzing data and reading ML papers. Very few people know how to / want to figure out how to build ML products that add value to humans. Do you want to just feel good and stay comfortable, or work on challenging things that reward you? Everyone has a spot on the spectrum they're comfortable with

\- Discomfort is how you grow. If you hate managing teams, figure out how to get leadership training, mentorship, feedback, and become so good at leadership that you start to enjoy it and it becomes part of your identity.

\- Extreme ownership -- take ownership of the problems in your team or organization. Not everything is your fault, but if you take ownership, people will give you more responsibility and you will build massive amounts of trust. Use that trust to get buy-in for high-risk projects you're personally passionate about (someone I know cashed in their internal trust to spend 1 day a week reading reinforcement learning papers and teaching the rest of the team). You don't get that on day 1 though.

\- Focus & prioritize the wildly important things at work. What types of activities will get you promoted? Which ones will get you fired? Which ones do you just need to do a ""good enough"" job at? Nobody got promoted because they planned their coworkers' birthday celebrations at work."

Arguably, one could say that you are not making this decision based on data, but on your expert opinion. So, therefore, you should give ChatGPT a chance, but with a big caveat.

My sincere suggestion is to tell them you will create an ensemble model that contains your solution mixed with the ChatGPT solution, which is superior to ChatGPT by itself. You could say, a specialized sentiment model plus the general ChatGPT. So, each model's predicted probabilities will be combined in a weighted fashion, such that the weights are hyperparameter tuned for performance. If that means ChatGPT ends up being weighted 0, then so be it. Whether you want to discuss that fact is up to you. It's a win-win, you will have done your ""due diligence,"" and it's the best compromise I can think of.

So the question is, what happens to your model after you create it?  How do people use it?

A common deployment strategy is to deploy models as REST micro services, essentially mini web apps.

This lets some other app/service interact with your model by sending a request with a data payload to your model's endpoint and get a response with a score.","Unless you work in Academia or big data organizations that have specialists for everything chances are you need to do at least some work that normally a data engineer, dev, etc would do.

Docker helps you be more independent of other resources as you can deploy models yourself, build small apps like interactive reports, apis etc.

For example in my line of work I need to be good at docker to push model-based microservices myself. Otherwise whenever I improve the model or want to change something in the pipeline I would need for a dev resource to do it for me. Now I simply push updated images to the kubernetes cluster myself and whole the rest of the app remains the same my model part can change and improve whenever I need it to."

As long as the data is supporting generally held beliefs, otherwise it is not so much of data-driven at all.

We spent an entire quarter of: **Okay last piece of evidence we requested confirms your point, but what about this other thing, did you check it out?**.

31-07-2023,172,Is R programming a useful skill to have in the current data science environment?," I'm a python programmer who knows R, and one of my best buddies is an R programming who knows python. 
Good things about R (what I see when I use R):
- For pure stats, hypothesis tests, and so on, usually there are more options in R and they work better.
- Shiny is great for creating dashboards and in my opinion more developed than dash (the python alternative).
- ggplot2 is superior to mpl/seaborn.
Bad things about R (what my buddy notices about R): 
- if you want to do ""machine learning"", specifically deep learning, it's just miserable.
- In general you lack engineering solutions that do not feel like a hobby project: polars, PySpark, Ray...
- OOP is terrible in R.
- versioning is extremely frustrating in R and sometimes close to a nightmare. 

Then, there are many topics where R and Python programmers will disagree: I don't like how R code is docummented, I don't prefer the tidyverse over pandas + polars...","I'm going to push back on the idea that everything R does python does better. R is a much narrower language than python. It was designed for statistical analysis. It's very good at what it was designed for. Python's strength is it's versatility.

If you can find a well paying analytics role, you'll learn the ropes when it comes to metrics, business insights, and reporting.  Nothing is stopping you from actually doing ML side projects for the company and getting that practice in too.  I was a PhD who started in BI and then product analytics, planning on eventually making the switch to DS/ML, but it was more fun and valuable for me to design logging, build out ETL, do analyses, build dashboards, and share insights with VPs and C-levels than it was to build ML models.  In any case, having analytics on your resume can only help you.","DS and analytics are going through a pretty big change right now, IMO.

> I'm severely overqualified, technically at least, for these roles...

The flip side of this: there are a lot of people with the title ""data scientist"" that are severely _overpaid_ for what is arguably ""data analyst"" work. Or, to put it another way, companies are realizing they can hire talented ""data analysts"" who are just as capable at 95% of the work ""data scientists"" were doing (but get paid a more reasonable salary for that work).

My advice: focus on an industry -- like finance or logistics -- or on a specific function -- like improving marketing or improving digital products. There are ML aspects to each of these, even if it's not pure ML.

Nowadays, showing up and saying, ""I'm really good at ML"" is like trying to get a construction job by saying, ""I'm really good at hammers."" No construction contractor hires someone because they're ""good at hammers"". They hire people because they know how to frame a house or how to pour a foundation.

Once you figure out the industry/function you want to specialize in, don't worry as much about the title. Focus on getting really good at that thing and take whatever job helps you do that better."

In most cases that’s just the way it is. 

TBH I get the sense that your frustrations are largely about the ritual of standups & retros etc getting in the way of what you feel to be your real work. That’s totally valid. It’s a common gripe in the tech industry that some teams/orgs over-index on these practices, having standups or retros more often than is necessary or practical. 

Personally, I’ve found the concept of team standups and retros to be useful to keep my finger on the pulse of what engineering folks are doing, as long as they aren’t so frequent that they’re really getting in the way of my own deliverables. 

When it comes to engineering work that’s being put on your plate, I really empathize. It’s a very tough balance to strike setting those boundaries, especially when you have a proven ability to operate effectively in both the science and engineering space. 

A big part of advancing in one’s career is learning when and how to set those boundaries. Sometimes expressing your needs works, sometimes it doesn’t and you need to decide if it’s worth looking for another opportunity. It’s a tough balance to strike. Good luck!","Strong SE ability can massively boost your DS ability, both in terms of multiplying what you can do in data science, and in terms of productionization, so this part is something to be embraced IMO. Getting better at this also means you can knock out any boring dashboarding tasks you have to do really quickly and move on.

It seems like your problems actually come from the management side of thing, i.e. (1) your time is being wasted in lengthy standups and retros, and (2) your time is being wasted on fixing UIs and SE-only tasks (as opposed to mainly DS, and only SE tasks that boost your actual DS work). A lot of the time, PMs will not understand what data science is about and how to get the most out of data scientists, or even what's possible. To solve this problem, you need to think quite far outside the box.

Here's my recommendation: Spend time figuring out what's possible and valuable in your org using the data they have, and your data science skills, and then convince the right people to make sure you actually get to work on it.

Not only is it not valid to do this (changing your method in response to a p-value being too high will inflate your false positives), but it's also just not necessary.

EDIT:
Reading some of your conclusions in the comments, you should really avoid making broad statements about whether a religion/text is “kinder” or more “hateful” based on a fickle measurement like sentiment. For example, if I say “you’re fucking awesome, dude!” most sentiment lexicons will flag that as negative because of the profanity, unable to tell it’s not the operative word. And what if a passage of text features an evil antagonist who does and says bad things, and the moral of the parable is to not be like that character? Is the text then hateful? Even more complex approaches like transformer-based sentiment models are still trained for a task that is extremely subjective.

ORIGINAL REPLY:
As someone who has done many projects similar to this one, I just want to point out that a term-frequency/lexicon approach like this (and indeed most NLP/textmining approaches) often winds up saying as much about the individual translator as it does about the source work. Religious texts written in old languages especially have a serious open-endedness in how they can be translated. 

A translator’s choices in which synonyms to use, how to conjugate verbs, or how to approximate the seemingly ubiquitous idioms in these texts can artificially distinguish between two texts that are much more similar in their meaning or original manuscripts.

Conversely, translation can also drown out the elements of authorial voice that make a piece of text unique.

If you want to take the next step in this analysis, I would advise getting your hands on the older source texts for each of these works, then you can try using the awesome CLTK library that can help parse old/extinct languages!","Does “art” mean the noun version of artistic or “are” as in the King James VErsion, (e.g. Thou art blessed among women) ?

23-06-2023,164,ryxcommar's tweet thread on why 2023 is a bad year to bootcamp your way to a data science job.,"Bootcamps usually are NOT a great way to go unless it's something like:Majored in Math at Princeton, want to do a SWE bootcamp to get a SWE job in a few months

&#x200B;

In that case, your math and reasoning skills aren't in doubt, you just need to learn to do a bunch of stuff, pretty quickly. It's cheaper and faster than a grad cert and it's enough to signal interest. Also a higher barrier to entry to SWE than ""analyst""","What he says pretty much falls in line with what I see these days too. 

We have shrinking numbers of entry level data scientist positions,  but most people know that

What fewer people have mentioned is that we have not only an increasing number of data science boot camps but an exploding number of data science and analytics masters degree programs. It is truly breathtaking to see just how many schools have started either a data science or an analytics master's degree program in the past 7 years.

People can debate the quality of these individual masters programs as much as they want, or debate choice between doing a master's in data science/analytics versus statistics. However, what really isn't up for debate is that a master's degree beats a boot camp, all other things being equal.

I live in the Chicago area and I think almost every University in the Chicagoland area has a data science or analytics master's degree program. Not just statistics and computer science, specifically data science and analytics. 7 years ago there were maybe two schools in the area that had one.

Additionally, another major change has been that the options for lower priced masters degrees have exploded as well. It makes absolutely no sense to pay $10,000 to $15,000 for a boot camp when you can pay the same amount for a master's degree, sometimes at a top 10 School.","Let’s be honest;  it was never a good idea to boot camp your way into a a data science job. The concepts that many data scientists want to use are easy to misuse, and a six week boot camp showing you how to build a regression model or deploy an xgboost model, or do woefully incorrect feature selection is a recipe for hitting  a glass ceiling really quick. 

You might clear a bar at place that really doesn’t understand “data science”, but in a lot of places where you have experienced individuals, especially those with stats backgrounds-your mileage is probably going to run out very fast.

The rebranding of a lot of degrees as data science is sadly another marketing push to take advantage of people and cash in on the ambiguity of what constitutes data science."
15-03-2023,167,How do you explain non-IT people what do you do?,I torture data until it says what the business suits want it to say.,[I find this short video pretty useful](https://streamin.me/v/b138d05f).,"I give examples of machine learning in applications they're familiar with, like Netflix and Amazon recommendations, Spotify discovery playlists, 538 election forecasting, economic forecasting, weather forecasting and so on. I mention that to do this, you need to use some interesting math and write programs that make those recommendations automatically without having to hire a person to look through you watch history and try to figure you out.   


Then I just say: I do that kinda thing, but for this particular set of users instead. For example, social media marketing, software sales teams, logistics, whatever it is I'm working on."
21-06-2023,168,“I would have benefited more with an MBA than a MS stats”,"This sounds more like a corporate culture thing than something industry-wide. My organization has most leadership roles filled with DS/Math/Science degreed folks (at least up through the director positions). A buddy of mine works for a company that will only consider you for leadership if you have a PhD in your respective discipline (chemistry/biology/environmental science/etc). 

She works in finance which has a different focus, so it sounds like the executive teams perceive the value of different educational backgrounds differently. Not inherently right/wrong but it likely influences her experience.","I assure you everyone reporting to her is happy she has her MS in stats.

Feels like a “I don’t fit in because they all have MBAs and I’m not in the MBA club” situation. Fitting in is a real hurdle because the number of available leadership jobs are limited and I’d argue there are already too many of them.

03-04-2023,166,New Data Science Manager: what should I know before starting?,"Explicitly ask your team how they prefer to be managed. Some people work better with greater autonomy, others want more defined direction. One size doesn't fit all.

Be vulnerable. Admit to your team that you will make mistakes, set the expectation that it's okay to mess up as long as we learn from it.

Be clear about expectations (both yours of your team and your team's expectations for you). My team is mostly mid-career to senior, so my role is weighted way more to the side of keeping people unblocked through stakeholder management than it is technical mentoring and project planning.

Make time to get to know your team as people. Probably sounds obvious, but a lot of managers don't.

Have regular 1:1s with your team that aren't just status updates. Dedicate time to asking what's working well for them, what isn't, what you could do to better support them. Make time to discuss their career goals and how you can help them level up there. Use them as opportunities for coaching, and to provide regular, timely feedback.

Have a clear team roadmap and OKRs that align to department/org strategy and objectives. Build this in partnership with your team, give them ownership of it and make sure they understand why the work they're doing matters.

Don't be afraid to kill projects that don't have a clear ROI. Being ruthless here is kinder than letting a project limp along for months without any path to delivering value. Not all models will succeed, that's okay, and it's not a reflection on the ability of the folks on your team.


Generally though, just try and be someone you wouldn't hate to get managed by. And keep learning. Radical Candor (Kim Scott), Principles (Ray Dalio), Start with Why (Simon Sinek), The Manager's Path (Camille Fournier) have all been worth the read for me personally.","General to starting in management: People in all fields tend to get promoted to manager on the basis of their performance as an IC. You will quickly see that not everyone who works for you is as good at the job as you were to earn the role. That's ok, your job is to deliver results, and you can do that in a huge variety of ways if you can figure out what people do well and get them to consistently do that. Step two is coaching then up so they can do more. If that's impossible then you're in the hardest part of management which is dealing with underperformers. That sucks but your new boss will have experience there, so lean on them. But take it slow: see what people can do for a while, like a month or a quarter, then try coaching collaboratively with your reports, then only if needed consult your boss on underperformers.


I tell all new managers to read Radical Candor. It's not a management bible but the perspective really helped me.


Also I liked this read:
https://oreilly-ds-report.s3.amazonaws.com/Care_and_Feeding_of_Data_Scientists.pdf","The most important thing to keep in mind, I think, is that management and leadership are skill that can be developed just like any other: though practice and study. Don't make the mistake of thinking that because you have been managed you understand what it means to do so, or to assume that being a good manager more or less amounts to some inherent characteristic.  


This is a career change, and in many ways you are now a junior again. So do the things you did when you were a junior. Read, study, get mentorship from more senior people in the career.   


A little humility goes a long way. Not only is it necessary for learning, but it's likely that the people you manage will be better at their jobs than you are at yours and they'll likely be able to tell. So be forthright about that. Explicitly tell them that you're a human, you'll make mistakes sometimes. But so will they. You'll have to support each other.  


That said, don't be apologetic for your position or behave as though you first have to prove yourself before you can act. You need to make the best decisions you know how to make and make them confidently and with some verve. Don't be wishywashy and don't be a pushover.   


Finally, I'll say that good management is all about developing systems. Systematize as much as you can without sacrificing dynamism and humanity. Don't just wing it. Have a system for regular communication, for giving feedback, for setting priorities and reporting progress, and everything else. You won't be able to will these into existence over night. But be thinking in terms of developing systems, not just reacting to situations."

19-03-2023,163,Statistical vs Machine Learning vs Deep Learning Modeling for Time Series Forecasting,"I wont link it here (not trying to dox myself) - my graduate research thesis was on this, and I presented similar findings. 

Often more complex (DL) approaches perform worse than a simpler approach. In a univariate timeseries, ARIMA/SARIMA/VAR tend to come out on top, and tree based models tend to perform best in a multivariate scenario. Further more, as you note here, ensemble models are particularly powerful in TS forecasting. 

I will say - I did not find time horizon to be a factor in performance of various models as you note above. 

Final comment on the topic....The biggest barrier between a DS practitioner and a good TS model is usually a fundamental misunderstanding of time series and its various components. Its repeatedly one of the most abused modeling subdomains, likely because its incredibly complex, yet the most exciting/powerful/desirable.

06-09-2023,160,Why so many data scientist complain about their work in this sub?,"You kind of said it yourself. 

Many people think that DS is just going to be building novel models the likes of which the world has never seen....they bound into the industry bright eyed and bushy tail...and then collide head first with Corporate America. 

Its been so hyped up...the whole 'sexiest job of the 21st century', the AI/ML boom, LLMs, influenceres, the peak of big tech big money, etc, etc...

When most of the time its just cleaning shit data, trying to deliver value from sub-optimal models, fighting with Data engineering, architecture, IT whoever, to get what you want done, playing corporate politics, etc...like every job. 

People think that DS/ML stands on its own merit...that just having a model will bring value....its the easy part. People want the big salaries they heard about and then *surpised pikachu face* the job is hard AF to be good at. 

Doesn't help that with an influx of younger professionals into the field they have to go through that 'my life is pointless, im a cog in a machine' phase that everyone, not just data scientists, go through at some point in their career. Eventually their spirit will break and they will come to terms with it. 

TL;DR - People (mostly new/junior) have unrealistic expectations about the field.","I keep hoping to see some good questions about predictive models but all this sub is is people that are like

FWIW I also incredibly enjoyed doing my PhD, but that was the last time I really did true ML development, also in imaging (over 10 years ago). Since then it's been 1) Where can I find a job? 2) Is this job completely toxic?

25-04-2023,159,How do you handle outliers in a dataset during data analysis? What techniques or methods can be used to detect and deal with outliers?,"One way is to look at the distribution of your data. For example if your data has a normal distribution then you'd expect most of the data to be near the mean with less data further away. You can calculate the standard deviation of your data and then look to constrain your tails.

For example I build insurance risk models and with anything like that you are going to get some weird results. So taking personal injury data we see an average of around £6,000, but it can (fortunately rarely) run into the millions. That's a problem - not because the outlier isn't real (it very much is) or because it doesn't have to be taken into account (it very much does) but because it is so big it screws up the model for the rest of the data and throws my base predictions out.

To compensate I look at the distribution of the data, and compare to the real world (something we often forget). What I see is a large amount of claims around £3k - £9k, a few £20k-£100k, and then very few up around £1m+. So I split my models up. I build a ""typical"" injury model for the low end which has all of my claims in regardless of size of claim, and I pair it to a severity model that only looks at claims in this range (this is typically unprovable soft tissue damage, like whiplash). That's my base model.

Then I build a model to look at my serious injury claims, between £20k up to around £125k. The distribution for these claims is sound, and I know that there is an MoJ (government) portal to handle things below £20k so these claims are all alike. But why £125k at the upper level? Well this is where our reinsurance kicks in. And then I stead of building a frequency prediction of this data I instead build a propensity model. So not how many claims are there, but of my typical frequency model what is the propensity that it will be a serious injury. Then I repeat the same for the really large claims.

Building a propensity model rather than a prediction model helps a lot. My rare outlier huge injuries are so rare that it is hard to build any sort of model on that data at all. So the propensity model distributes those large claims among all the more-likely-to-have-an-injury-in-the-first-place claimants. It's a step above just summing it up and applying it equally (there's a propensity for young drivers to have injury claims, and among injury claims there's a propensity for young drivers to have large claims).

It can really depend a lot on the data and the reasons it exists. But look at real life reasons and look at distributions and ask yourself if your outliers are sufficiently different that they should be rounded up into their own propensity model.",I simply ★｡  🎀  𝒹𝑒𝓁𝑒𝓉𝑒  🎀  ｡★ them 😘💅,"Depends on what you're trying to do with them.

03-07-2023,154,Do you study outside of work?,Boss makes a dollar and I make a dime. That’s why I study ML on company time.,"Early in my career, **for sure**. I needed to upskill faster for the career growth I wanted. That included a lot of CS-type stuff that isn't in my academic background, more ML type stuff, etc. DS makes your wear a lot of hats!

Now, as a senior DS? Sure, but it's not the same at all. I do a lot more bookmarking, casual stuff, and then I dig in more deeply on company time as my projects allow. As a senior there's also a mentorship aspect to that (or maybe that's me rationalizing?) because I do share interesting links / topics with teammates if it's relevant to their work.

Edit: @OP, based on some of your past posts/comments, I'll target a few thoughts.

* It is common (but not guaranteed) for DS work to have ""learn how to solve new problem X time"" built in. This is especially true if you're on a newer team or DS is new to your org and you're a bunch of generalists getting bizarre, malformed questions thrown your way.

* It is common in DS to feel like everyone knows stuff and you don't. Given the broad backgrounds and diverse paths to the field, it is easy to get math/stats (or even CS) ""envy"". If you're forcing yourself to study outside of work because you feel imposter syndrome, you really need to take objective stock of your skills. Don't risk burnout because of a phony feeling of inadequacy.

 * If you regularly feel like you're getting buried in requests beyond your skills, really figure out if you have bad management / a terrible pipeline for requests, or if you're missing skills. Work with your manager to fill those skills and to set the right expectation with stakeholders (unless the problem is your management sucks -- in that case, get out and save yourself).

* If I'm way off and assuming things like a prick, ignore me entirely. Maybe someone else will get something out of the ramblings, though.","I'm a mid-skill DS/DA. I still study on my own time but I'm getting to the point where I have a strong foundation in statistics, predictive modeling, data analysis, R, SQL and Tableau. The only area I have to catch up is Python. Once that's at a decent level, I'll study primarily during company time and only casually on my own time (reading a book/article). Once you get the fundamentals down, the more complex methods have steep diminishing returns. It's more about developing domain knowledge, social skills/network, communication, etc.

I would love to hear other people's experiences."
06-05-2023,154,Data science is overspecialized (or me underspecialized)?,"I think of the “science” as a real description of what the data scientist is supposed to do, “science”. Hypothesis tested, building on research., science things.

Follow the skills that you have and enjoy at any given moment. Lateral transitions to new roles aren’t hard if you have a shallow but broad understanding of how computation/computers/networks work. DS does identify of course with theory/stats/math closely, so don’t force it if that’s not you. You’ll be exposed easier as a DS that doesn’t like/know the field than a DE that doesn’t have experience. Try something new. The canonical DS role is exactly what you described hating. DS and DE can be widely different and DE may just provide the SWE tasks you enjoy.","In my experience, the ""technical part of the job"" as you call it has been the majority of the job. Knowing DS tools and workflows is of course important, but you can set yourself apart from other Data Scientists based on your knowledge of engineering tools and software practices.

Three red flags we watch out for though, when a candidate doesn’t know the answer: 

1. They answer confidently but are bullshitting.

2. They answer like a politician and ramble a bit without admitting they don’t know the actual answer. 

3. They specifically list a technique as something they’ve used at work but can’t answer basic theory Qs about it. Make sure you understand any model/ technique you plan on mentioning in the resume or past projects.","This is a tricky thing but thinking out loud here, maybe some example suggestions:
- “I don’t know this technique specifically by name, but I have dealt or come across many data and algorithm techniques so if you can give me some intro clues about it, I can talk through my understanding of the underlying question.”
- “I have not come across this technical problem before, but I would like to know a little more about it briefly so I can reason with it in this interview.”
- “I don’t know about it, but I have learnt many techniques in my experience, and I am very confident I can get my head around it to do the job required.”

Honesty and integrity goes a long way. And also know that a job such as data science places a premium on the skills of prolonged in-depth problem solving. In the end, it’s about hiring the people that can solve the problems well, by developing the right solution that can stand the test of time."
13-04-2023,150,Reflecting on the Changing Hiring Bar,"I'm in the UK and have been in the field for 8ish years. When I got started I had a BSc in Actuarial Science and Maths and no knowledge of data science.

I was interviewing people for a junior DS role recently and we had to take the job down within 24 hours as we'd already got more applications than we could reasonably review. I ended up interviewing 6 people, all of whom had a relevant masters, solid coding/programming skills, and a decent understanding of DS as a field. With the exception of lacking real woo experience, they were probably all roughly at the level I was at after a few years on the job.

The competition is stiffer now, there are more universities and bootcamps churning out people with a mish-mash of DS skills, and the internet is full of resources.","Roles in Bay Area and tech companies have always been more SWE focused.

It's an art of educating your stakeholders on what is possible without telling them you can't do something and guiding them to the conclusion that more time, resources, people are needed without giving them the idea that you are the problem, while simultaneously ensuring they think these are their original ideas. It is an art and takes time and practice to develop but it is necessary for both parties so no one over promises, gets caught off guard, misrepresents features, gets burned out, etc."
06-01-2023,150,Why are there more remote positions in the US than in EU,"I suspect it is probably easier to operate in different states , or have employees in different states with headquarters in one state then it is to have employees in different countries

We have offices in multiple EU countries - those employers are NOT USA employees - they are employed by the respective country . They have to live in the country of the office .",Because a remote position in EU is another country.,"A large part is the taxes, and if you work in a different country for x days you need to pay local tax, transfer to a local subsidiary, insurance is voided, etc it's quite complicated. After corona i imagine eu-legislation will evolve to meet the demands. 
Most social benefits are tied to the countries system not the company (daycare, health, sickleave). 
For Sweden, if you are contracted WFH for more than 50% of your working hours they (your employer)must provide you with a ergonomic workspace ie desks screens etc so while i can work from home 100%, or Spain for 3 months, it can't be included in my contract else the government will be mad...The welfare systems are built on taxes and spending being in the same country as it's used..."

1)No tangible difference during the interviews between candidates with and without masters.(UK based, which could prove this biased)
2) PhDs, with rare exceptions, were lacking breadth of skills needed for the job but were standing out in one maximum two disciplines(I would never hire, apart from those rare exceptions)
3) Many candidates don't understand the fundamentals, and I'm not talking about math. CV, metrics, workflows, EDA, ML models
4) Many candidates have no software development skills/habits.

It shouldn't be. Like in any other area, having teams that are idle doesn't make any sense. It speaks for mismanagement of some kind or other. 

For non-tech companies it can happen that the data maturity is too low or the processes within a company don't align with what is necessary to do 'data-driven' work.

What does your supervisor, what does your team say? Are they equally frustrated, do they have projects? Is everyone just sitting around the whole day? If you really can't find any work, I assume that you've talked with your supervisor? What did they say?

> I'm also kind of concerned about Chat GPT4. My company sells products in the NLP space and with Chat GPT4, I feel like our products will be pretty obsolete soon.

I'm not working in that space, myself. Having said that, now that it is so popular, every company on the earth will want a similar solution to ChatGPT for their own data. Skills in this area just have become more valuable. 

I recently read about security breaches where Samsung employees uploaded sensitive data to OpenAI servers.  I'm sure Samsung and others will have demand for people who can help write guidelines, sensibly limit the use of ChatGPT or who can develop local models or implementations. Also, any company that wants to make their large corpus of information and documents accessible as an internal knowledge-base will have a need for experts. Open AI can't/won't cover them all.

It's a bit like the invention of the iPhone, try not to be Nokia or BlackBerry but there is plenty of non-Apple mobile phones companies who are doing well 20 years later because they kept up and kept innovating.

I get the frustration of having the lonely job of sourcing ML projects that no one is necessarily looking for. In some aspects that can be part of our job to do exploration and to find value - but this kind of work needs a certain level of support for the data scientists, too, as well as integration into the broader company.

Not having any work for months on end would frustrate me. Personally, I'd try and work through the frustration and upskill - though, realistically I could probably only keep this up for a year at max...

If you're interested in product management, can you maybe shadow these guys for a while and learn more about the job?","Well, I spent one and a half year in the exact same situation as yours at GM. Got hired by an ""artificial intelligence manager"" who was supposed to foster an AI revolution within a relatively known company in my country. Five months later, without a single tangible project to show (because everything this manager did was to hire overpriced specialists), he got fired and we were pushed aside. Not long after, my peers jumped ship and I was the sole DS guy there.

The next 12 months were a nightmare because I spent a whole lot of time chasing projects and trying to build a network. The company was not data-driven at all and not even in the IT roadmaps I heard the word ""data"" a single time. When I gave the odd presentation on AI and DS, people were Disney-like amazed, but then the subject was left in oblivion very quickly. 

I had no official projects, no project manager, no coordinator or manager (I reported directly to an IT director), no methodologies, nothing. The company itself did not take care of their data infrastructure - if I wanted to do any harm to the data of the company, there was basically nothing that would prevent me from that.

The most mysterious thing was that my director absolutely loved me and pretty much despised lots of other employees from non-DS projects that worked a lot more than I did. During my final days in the company, this director began firing people and saying that ""everybody is bad"", but for some unknown reason he wanted to keep me at all costs.

Of course I did not believe him and I left as soon as a good opportunity came in. Later on I found out that the company was basically firing everybody and my turn would eventually come. 

PS: Why didn't I leave the company right away just like my peers did? Well, the paycheck was very good and I could take a lot of the time for studies and personal things, but I knew it was an unsustainable situation in the long run. Nowadays, when discussing an opportunity, I always ask things like ""which is the data roadmap for the company"", ""what is your philosophy on data"" and things like it.","Just enjoy your work, deliver what you need to keep the job, cash your paycheck and cherish the free time you have because it really is the most precious gift."

10-02-2023,137,For those who interview folks for prospective data science roles. What is the most common reason people don’t move forward in the interview process?,"The most common reason is that it becomes clear they don't have as much experience - or as much depth of experience - with something that we either think is important or with something that they portrayed themselves as being proficient in.

Someone who moves to an interview stage is generally going to be someone whose resume is exactly what we're looking for. So if the person that I interview is the person in the resume, odds are you are going to keep moving through the process unless a) there is another candidate who is even better, or b) your personality is absolutely impossible to deal with.

For most roles I've hired, I haven't had multiple candidates to choose from - it almost always ends up being one person who is good and then we hire them. 

So the people that don't move forward are normally people who, for example, said they had experience deploying machine learnings in production, and when you ask them ""tell me about a model you've taken to production"" they say ""well, I have a script in Matlab that I run in my laptop once a month and then dump the results in a production database"". 

The 2nd most common reason is that what they're looking to do is not what we need them to work on. This tends to normally be people who want to be building deep learning models and I know in the role I'm hiring for they will be lucky to build a logistic regression.","Top 3 reasons for not moving forward in the interview process:
- only wanting to do ML / DL
   [“I’m not here to clean data.”, “I’m not doing Data Engineering.” etc]
- having totally unreasonable salary expectations
   [“I just graduated from a Bootcamp and you have to pay me at least $150K pro year.”, “This is going to be my first DS position, after working as a DA for a year my base salary should be at least $180K”…]
- being arrogant / lacking basic interpersonal skills
   [We had several technically skilled candidates that we didn’t not move forward with, since they were condescending, arrogant, etc.]","When we're down to 3 from 50, at that point the 3 possess solid technical/mathematical skills (technical rounds). But, the successful candidate in 3rd/4th interview rounds is someone who can articulate their ideas very well. Primary reason being our core team communicates with management/leadership teams often to present ideas and recommendations. The candidates should be able to withstand questions, going off the script, and have the ability to course correct wisely."
18-01-2023,134,Any advice on using Pandas as a data analyst?,"You might already know this but a dataframe is a spreadsheet in a programming language.  Panda's dataframes is basically Excel in Python.  It is a different programming language than the Excel language, and a different syntax, so it can take a while to learn.

You'll want to learn:

1. Python

2. Notebooks, like JuypterLab.  This lets you run small code snippets and preview what you're doing, similar to looking at the Excel spreadsheet while you're modifying it.

2. An SQL Python library, so you can pull data in.  A serialization library so you can save the SQL query to your hard drive.  (Eg pickle, csv, or similar.)

3. A dataframe library like Pandas and some basic syntax for it.

4. A plotting library.  It's pretty rare to not need to plot something.  plotly is pretty good.

It's a few steps, so pacing yourself goes a long way.  But once you learn it all you'll be a power user.",My number one tip is to emphasize using sql to query the most relevant data representation for your expected analysis. Junior data analysis almost universally query a granular dump into a huge pandas dataframe. This drastically slows the pace of analysis as you have to wade through irrelevant data and reaggregate,"Personally, I like to mention that as an analyst, I found R to be simpler and better use for structured data.

That's what they're paying you to do.  Even if it's technically an IC role and you're not officially managing anyone.  

Your best bet is probably to keep making lateral seniority hops to higher-paying companies until you've reached your limits for what kind of company you can feasibly get into.","Let me tell you something, I'm a senior data scientist too and I haven't even begun to peak.

05-09-2023,130,How would YOU handle Data Science recruitment ?,"So, my reference point is as a hiring manager and a manager of hiring managers. I've done the exact process you're talking about and while I'm sure candidates would still complain about the process, I'm happy with it.

Bottom-line summary: research best practices and try to implement the parts that are within your means.

My recommendations:

- Get your job descriptions right; HR/recruiting can own the listing, but it should link to the actual internal role/job description that your team writes and edits. You need to get this right to control what you look for in a candidate, appraise performance and progression of people in role, and reduce the noise from things that aren't a bona fide requirement of the work.
- Develop criteria for eliminating resumes without a phone screen. Great if this is automated, otherwise write it like a manual acceptance/regression test that HR/you can follow to eliminate resumes. You probably want to combine a high level view of the resumes you've received for this role/historically and the job description to decide what resumes to eliminate. You also want to tune the aggressiveness of the elimination to how many resumes you get. We get ~700-2000 resumes for entry-level positions, so we're aggressive in eliminating: needs a bachelor's degree in a pre-defined applicable field, needs to be local or willing to relocate (we're hybrid for local employees and allow full-time remote work for experienced individual contributors), can't require visa sponsorship (in keeping with the law, a role with 2000 applicants is hard to demonstrate a need for a visa), can't have any errors or unprofessional formatting on the resume, resume must not appear to have come from any application farms.
- 20-minute phone screen with HR. They're looking for communication skills, professionalism, and the ability to describe relevant projects (likely school or internship projects for entry-level employees).
- Take-home test. I know - applicants hate these. But we need to distinguish the technical skills of applicants somehow. This step will determine who actually gets hiring manager and team interviews. We make these as simple as we can and ask candidates not to gold plate. We also score them using quantitative measures on 4 dimensions (correctness, deployability, documentation, quality/style). The nice thing about a take-home test, the reviewers don't have to know the name or any other identifying features of the candidate. This is lot like a blind audition in an orchestra (which improved diversity in orchestras). Make sure the take home test perfectly overlaps with specific skills and expectations on the job description. Asking an analyst to make a website, a data scientist to implement a sorting algorithm, or an MLE to take an IQ test are all BAD examples.
- Manager interview. We teach our managers to ask a consistent set of questions, though they can vary a little from role to role. We're very much looking for growth mindsets, ability to deal with adversity, ability to work through ambiguity during HM interviews.
- Team interview. More technically focused with potential future teammates digging into the details of their technical math and programming skills.
- Decision. Every detail about the candidate is collated into a place where the hiring manager can see it. Everyone has rated the candidate on a 4-point scale (no mid-point in a 4-point) and the HM can make a decision. We don't have a group discussion about candidates because this is a place where bias and politics can sneak in. If you rated a candidate highly in the applicant tracking system, they are hireable - no politicking for your favorite candidate. This eliminates a very sneaky place bias can creep in.

Overall, it's more important for you to quickly get to a good enough candidate than it is to optimize for the experience of the candidates in the pipeline. Emphasis on quick. While there are large numbers of applicants, we're finding that the best candidates are going to get offers during the hiring process if we don't move fast. Speed is a critical element of quality outcomes in our hiring process. We'd like to be done with the listings and recruiting in the first week or two and going from phone screen to offer in a week (or two in rare cases). If the process takes longer, you are going to suffer from churn in the pipeline which is a negative feedback loop.","When I was working for an agriculture company as a hiring manager it was during a time where candidates were very limited and I had very little experience myself to be making big decisions, but I was very proud of a system I made up that got me some of my best employees. 

I would ask interviewees a technical question and ask them to live code it (take a LeetCode style problem for example, I would ask something usually from the easy side). They could ask me questions and ask for constraints as they’d like, and they would eventually try to program the answer. For those who got it right, I would ask them follow up questions and for their thought process and proceed as normal.

For those that got it wrong, as long as I could see they had some amount of familiarity with programming I would actually give them a follow up interview a couple of days later. In that follow up, I would ask them whether or not they looked into the problem I gave them more and whatever they learned. Then I would ask if they’d like to show me what they learned by trying again.

As silly as it sounds, I actually found some people would just get nervous at the interview or couldn’t get past a mental block and would then proceed to bomb. But the people that took the time afterwards to learn from their mistakes to the point they felt confident with the answer proved they knew how to do their work, they just needed a bit more time. And it’s not like we work here without computers. Very few times does someone at a non-senior level need to be excellent on the spot. Most of the time, they just need to build some confidence.

I’m not advocating for people to turn their out of work lives into constant programming and grinding, but if someone showed the willingness to learn from their mistakes that carried a lot of weight. I actually hired 2 people based on that, both of them becoming top performers. 

I would love to see this more in some shape or form in the industry.","Depends on the type of role. This is probably how I would think about doing it. Quick disclaimer, I've never actually had to take a hiring process from beginning to end, so this would be subject to change if something weren't working. 


For a position requiring 1-2 YOE:

1. Blind the resumes. Remove name and anonymize education. At the initial filter stage I want don't want any potential subconscious biases to influence opinions on whether or not a candidate can do a job. 

2. Set aside referral candidates for HM review.

3. Sort resumes into two piles - those with professional experience (including internships) and those with no professional experience. 

4. Eliminate those with no experience. Send out rejection email.

5. Separate resumes into preferred experience pile and other pile. If the role is focused on product experimentation, set aside resumes with relevant experience. Same for any other domain. Preferred experience candidates get sent to HM.

6. Sort resumes into more piles - those with graduate degrees, undergraduate degrees and bootcamps.

7. More piles - preferred degrees (heavily depends on role responsibilities. In some cases the preferred degree is CS, in others something more stats related)

8. Eliminate pile with non-preferred degree+no graduate degree.

9. If further cuts are needed, preference is given to graduate degree holders. 

10. If even more cuts are needed, preference is given to graduate degree holders with publication history (includes research based thesis). Capstone projects are removed from consideration.


Once the pile of resumes is sent to the HM, the HM would create a shortlist (10 or so) of candidates to interview.

**Round 1:** Interview with the HM. Standard stuff here, ask about prior roles etc. Candidates are given a pass/fail based on a standardized performance rubric.

**Round 2:** Technical round. Candidates are given a choice between three options. Live coding, take home, or the option to walk the interviewer through something they've done in the past. Candidates are given a pass/fail based on a standardized performance rubric.

**Round 3:** Situational round. Candidates are given a situation (marketing wants to do XYZ, how would you set it up and measure it/determine if it was successful) and walk the interviewer through their thought process. This round is scored on a ranked scale based on a standardized performance rubric. Can be combined with technical in an extended interview session (45 minutes).

**Round 4:** Team fit/behavioral. One short round with teammates, one with stakeholders. 

**Offer**"

15-08-2023,131,Is LeetCode style coding essential for Data Science?,"LeetCode style coding isn't even essential for software engineering jobs. It's a lazy proxy to being an effective coder and an even more removed proxy to general intelligence.

A lot of DS and DA jobs I post get 500-2000 applicants. I understand the impulse to thin it down using LeetCode, even if I don't think that's right to do.

That said, I learned advanced coding skills before my math skills advanced and that actually helped me interact with the math topics I was learning in a more hands-on fashion.","So, I have two conflicting thoughts on this:

On the one hand, leetcode has nothing to do with data science ability. It is somewhat correlated to like the 2% of data science work that would deal with that type of problem statement.

On the other hand, leetcode allows you to showcase your ability to learn in a controlled environment and demonstrate your ability to problem solve creatively.

Ultimately, I think it's a tool that will give you very few false positives, and a lot of false negatives - i.e., you'll disqualify a lot of qualified candidates, but the ones that pass will probably be pretty good candidates.

My biggest qualm with this approach is that it biased your candidate pool towards people who have ample free time, i.e., people who have time either during work or after work hours to grind leetcode. 

If you're a parent of 3 kids - hell, if you're a single parent of kids - or if you have an elderly parent you take care of, or you have a really demanding job? It's a lot harder to grind leetcode. So there's a very tacit type of discrimination that is happening in taking this approach.","I think the best way to approach LeetCode is to view it as a standardized test like the SAT/ACT or GRE/GMAT. In general we know that standardized tests are not a true indication of a persons ability, but nonetheless it can still serve as a (weak/moderate) signal of their ability."

12-09-2023,131,Anyone else feel likeability / charisma plays too much of a role when interviewing?,"Few things from my perspective but firstly this is a bit of a given isn't it? 

If you are an effective communicator you're going to be better able to communicate with your interviewer.... 

But in addition good communication and storytelling are arguably the most important skills after a baseline technical ability is met. Being the technical genius they wheel out of the cupboard to solve the problems just doesn't work practically because when Bob in sales needs to know why he should give a shit about what your modelling / analytics / insight etc says and why he should use it over his hunches it doesn't matter how good your model is if you can't tell a story and persuade it. In most businesses 90% of the workforce is going to be non technical stakeholders and how well you communicate in your interview is likely to be a representation of how well you will communicate throughout your projects.


Both skills can be learned but I'd argue that with a baseline knowledge it's much easier to learn the technical skills than it is to develop good communication


Just a few thoughts from me but yeah when I'm recruiting I'd rather have people that can communicate well and have a baseline technical understanding than a rockstar that can't hold a conversation",I'd rather work with somebody that's easy to get along with than somebody smart but makes coordinating a chore.,Soft skills are just a natural way for non-technical hiring managers to filter out candidates.

On the upside, I snuck a waitress from an Applebee’s I was dishwashing at in through my window one night. Seemed less awkward than introducing a fling to my parents, lol.

31-03-2023,129,Noticing increase in frequency of DS/ MLE being called analysts,As long as they’re paying me engineer money they can call me whatever they want,"Some companies in industries (like the one I’m in) are required by regulators to maintain their pay scales based on published industry books (now digital portals). Those pay scales are based on title, location, years exp, education and that’s it. Sometimes the more complicated ones will take some skills into question, but that part is subjective.

So their trick to get around it, title hack. They want a datascientist for analyst pay, call it a data analyst or business analyst or something made up like data science citizen. If they can’t fill roles they want they go the other way and add “manager” to the title and give them no team. So if they actually want a data scientist but the market is demanding more than their regulators and book allow, they call it data science manager or give it a more obscure name with manager or director in the title to avoid specifics of the book. Sort of like investment banks calling everyone a VP.

S - situation. Give background for why you are presenting, why you needed to focus on this issue, give context, etc. 

T - task. Talk about what needed to be done, what the exact problem was, what your responsibilities were, etc. 

A - action. What did you actually do? Get into the nitty gritty of what steps you took (keep it linear/orderly) and why you took them, etc. 

R - result. What is the outcome from your work? What did you change, how have you improved something, what did you find?","One small tip I learned that’s really helpful is to make your slide titles descriptive *points* not just a description of what’s on the slide.

Say you’re presenting findings from an analysis of profitability across different customer segments and you are showing a visual of aggregate profit margin by sales from each country. Rather than calling the slide “Profit Breakdown by Country” you might instead let the title lead right into the conversation, e.g. “US customers are most profitable, closely followed by UK” or similar.

This is a really simple/dummy example but the principle can apply to anything you’re presenting and I’ve found that it not only helps stakeholders, it also helps me tell the right story and figure out what’s important.","My rule of thumb when giving presentations is the following:

1) always shoot for less than the allotted time even after including time for questions. For example, for a 1 hour seminar I usually shoot for 35-40 minutes for the presentation. No one is going to complain if your presentation is shorter. 

2) Assume everyone in the room has an attention span of a toddler. Always recall back to the major points of the presentation throughout the talk. 

3) visuals should be the majority of the slides. If you have to have texts keep it VERY minimum. Like a one phrase summary at the top usually is enough. Remember, the slides are a supplement to your talk, not the another way around. 

4) practice your talk. As you gain experience you won't have to practice at all. But when you first start out, having a safe place to practice the talk helps keep the nerves down. 

5) I find it helpful to ask peers for feedback on the presentation. It might be hard to take criticism but think of it as constructive criticism to build on."

28-02-2023,124,"People who work as a Data Scientist in consulting companies like Deloitte, what’s your experience been like? Would you recommend it as opposed to working for a startup even though startups offer more salary than consulting firms?","I did a bunch of DS-like work at a Deloitte competitor. Skyaa194 comment is spot on. 

Two things I’ll add: 

- Consulting companies sell projects; startups sell products. Your soft skills (shmoozing with partners, talking with clients, drinking with colleagues) are much more important at a consulting company. 

- travel isn’t easy, especially after a few years. Make sure your life is set up so you can just disappear for 4 days/week.","Former Deloitte DS here. It depends on the startup in question. If the start up has good DS leadership and experienced data scientists I would go there. 

In Consulting, especially as a novice, you won’t have much control over the projects you’re staffed on. You may end up doing random things or more data analyst or data engineering work. The pipeline for cool DS projects is not steady and there’s competition to get on cool projects. More experienced and skilled practitioners will tend to win out. 

I’d take Deloitte over a start up with few data scientists and where DS isn’t properly embedded into the business. You’re likely to just be a SQL/Dashboard monkey. If you’re gonna be that might as well do it at Deloitte and experience different industries and companies.","Although I haven't worked in consulting as a DS, I have inherited work from them and one thing that I've noticed is that the work is typically rushed, code is messy, there is a lot of tech debt, and the solution is designed poorly overall. Maybe it's because of tight deadlines or the fact that they don't have to maintain their code or maybe I have just gotten unlucky, I don't know, but there does seem to be a trend.

So while I totally see the value in ""wearing many hats"" (I worked at agencies for this exact reason), the breadth definitely comes at the expense of depth, the latter of which you'll definitely receive at a startup."

Maybe they found a hacky way to optimize it but not in the degrees of freedom needed.,"That's all very well reasoned technical explanations, but I can give you the very clear business reasoning: COGS.

At the end of the day, OpenAI needs to deliver a model that can be run at a business viable operating expense for companies that will consume it. Right now, there are certain use cases where the presently available GPT models are NOT economically viable for high frequency applications -- especially if fine-tuning is necessary. If GPT-4 was comically larger than GPT-3, then it would certainly balloon costs to where very few business applications would be able to absorb the impact to their COGS at a gross margin that made their business operators comfortable.",Will they have to retrain GPT4 completely or can then reuse the parameters from GPT3.5 and build a differential model on top?

It’s like they think they’re hiring an all-in-one solution for the entire backend.,"In my experience, the single greatest issue amongst data scientists is ego. 

This is a very broad field that attracts smart people from multiple fields and backgrounds. In any one team, you may have a physics PhD, an economics MS, and a statistics BS all working together. This is the best part about this field. The problem of this diversity is two fold: implicit hierarchy and ambiguity in terms of DS problem solving. 

Your average PhD will almost always assume the role of “smartest”, which may be true. But this comes at the expense of burying other team members’ ideas and contributions that may be best for the project. 

For example, critiques during model review. Let say the the economics MS builds a simple linear ARIMA time series forecasting model and uses PCA to do some initial time series decompression. The physics PhD then proceeds to view this problem and solution through their lens. They ask “why didn’t you model this series as a sinusoidal function?” or “why aren’t we using Fourier transforms to decompose this time series?”. In my experience, these questions exist to condescend and assert the “superior” knowledge of the PhD amongst the team. 

Ultimately, data science is just as much of an art as it is science, as their is no singular way to do any single task. We need more open mindedness amongst data scientists and we should learn to leave ego and academic competitiveness at the door when we come in to do our jobs each day.",The job title *data scientist*

Part of a DS job is to ensure that what you do is understandable by both management and other team members so that if you go jump in a volcano and die other people can pick it up and there's some business continuity. At my old job, we had a situation where somebody left after implementation of a model that was very complicated. This person had even left documentation, but once it broke we realized there were issues and couldn't figure out how to resolve them. So, AFAIK, that model never got put back into production and all that time was wasted, point being it is a lot worse if you don't even have docs and nobody knows what anybody else is doing.",">Of course, implementing better code practices such as commenting and better naming would be a good thing, but this idea is often met with the ""We don't have time to do that, we have worse problems and priorities"".

However, I felt that on top of that it requires extensive testing, tweaking, and fine-tuning of the model. Including lots of BRAINSTORMING.","Well my manager and my manager’s manager don’t know the difference between classification and regression and think me an Oracle.

The consultant promises a nice horse with very realistic frame and everything. Exec is sold. 12 months later, the said consultant team(s) deliver a stick figure of a horse.

19-07-2023,112,What are people’s thoughts on SAS?,No its more like sas exists because of regulatory capture and vendor lock in,"SAS has been around for a long time.  It was developed in the 70s on the mainframe.  The Language with PROC and DATA step look like it.

Many of us older folks did SAS back in the day.  I did SAS in school on the mainframe in the 1980s and on unix systems at work in the 1990s - 2010s, in addition to doing a bunch of other different stuff.

Doesn't mean we like it when we've used it for so long.  But here's what some people don't know.  SAS is used more for data movement and transformations, along with putting together 'reports' than it is used for analytics.  Back in the mainframe days, a lot of business apps were written in COBOL.  I'm one of those culprits.  But for non-programmers, SAS was a 4GL that was much easier to code than COBOL.

SAS DATA STEP let you move files from one spot to another in a few lines of code.  It let you do transformations and formatting with a few more lines of code.  So there is a lot of SAS from the 1980s -2000s that are not doing analytics at all.  They are doing reporting.  SAS is still around in these installations because no one wants to rewrite that code.

SAS/Access software on \*nix systems is pretty nifty.  If you want to get a pile of data on that Oracle source system to your data warehouse system that might be in Teradata or some other parallel database, SAS/Access with DATA STEP in 3 lines of code will get it moved from one system to another.  With 5-6 lines of code you can optimize it so it takes advantage of the database vendors parallel capabilities.  This gets used a ton in places I've been.  Again, no analytic work here.  Just data movement.  To do some of this in Python or R is more code, or not very efficient.

All the above is not to praise SAS.  I prefer python libraries to do analytic work.  Have for many years.  But there are a lot of installations with decades of processes that ensure SAS is not going away anytime soon.

SAS has tried to modernize and has made a little bit of progress in that area, but not much in my opinion.  For most folks Python / R will be a better fit than SAS nowadays.  I left my previous company after doing SAS off and on for over 15 years, and have not touched it at all where I am now.

One thing good about SAS is the support.  SAS is expensive and those that say it's expensive probably have not used SAS support very much.  I used it all the time.  I've had a coworker in the past have a Ph.D. algorithm expert from SAS on the line and emails with my coworker working through a problem with her.  SAS support, in my experience has been top notch.  I spent a lot of time on the SAS campus with my previous company.  We were partnering with them on some things.  I'd go say hello to the support folks on campus to put a face to a name.  

One thing about SAS, is they give their folks fantastic work conditions on the SAS campus.  Pretty much everyone, even the support folks, have their own private office with a door.  And these offices are well equipped.  I'm thinking that's where some of that money that you are paying to SAS goes.  Work life balance on the SAS campus seemed pretty good compared to the company I worked for at the time.  40 hours per week and done.

All that being said, I don't use SAS anymore.  I'm using Snowflake, DBT, Fivetran, Python stat/ML libraries and having a good time with that.

Sorry for long comment, but wanted to give my $0.02 on my experience with SAS.","The main benefit of SAS is it can be used in highly regulated industries, and is even designed to do so. They (SAS) have a ton of people that write really good documentation for all their functions/programs so you know exactly what it is doing and how it is doing it. That is why many pharma, medical, and insurance companies use it, which has more regulation than a tech start-up. Literally, everything in SAS has been documented, tested, and thoroughly explained documentation written for anything you can do in it."

&#x200B;

an analogous question would be ""why use git when we can just edit files in notepad and email them""","The key concept you're looking for is 'interface'.  An interface is a way for multiple engineers to easily interact with code someone else wrote.

Say you've got a 10 page script.  Without documentation the engineers don't know what part of the script to call to run the model, what to run to train the model, what parts to call to log errors, what parts to call to get the output from the script and so on.  They'd rather have a convenient interface that is consistent.  So to run the model they might only need to write `model.predict(<new data>)` and collect the output and that's it, super easy.  Or maybe your interface is more complex.  `model.getErrors()` or something like that.

In short, it makes their life easier.  Also the documentation explaining how to run the model can be more straight forward.  Likewise, an interface reduces bugs.  What if they want to run multiple models at once?  Running multiple scripts at once can crash.  Running multiple class instances at once eg `model1.predict()` and running `model2.predict()` at the same time shouldn't crash.

Is a class required?  No, but they want the ease and lack of complexity.  They want an interface to make life easy.  A class is the most common way to create an interface, so it's what they want.","We have some pipelines like that - where the model is essentially treated as a complex data transformation in a pipeline.

We're moving in the direction of deploying models as RESTful micro-services.  This means our production models are essentially small apps.

We're doing this because it makes it easier to score against models on demand and also provides a greater degree of modularity, providing cleaner separation between the scoring function and how that score is integrated back into production systems."

You’re going to be hard pressed to find a company offering exorbitant TC in the Midwest if you’re not willing to move further into management.,"Posts on here are very skewed. Someone making an average salary isn't going to advertise it like someone making $200k+. People also get into startups or other roles offering equity and lump that in. Then a lot of DS roles are in HCOL areas so salaries are adjusted. I was in SOCAL and made $90-150k in total comp over a 3 year period between raises and a promotion. Wanted to move home (not a major city) and found out those salaries don't really exist, so I actually took a pay cut and now make $120k (some might see this as a bad move).

I was an in-house recruiter for tech professionals (ML engineer, software dev etc.) and ballpark 70% of applicants are not qualified (current students, international applicants with no mentioning of moving to Canada, resumes in a foreign language LOL). The job market rn is noticeably worse than last year's imo so don't feel defeated if you don't get a certain job. It's a numbers game and it's not a you problem.

12-06-2023,114,"I read posts that make my data analytics company seem a generation or two behind the cutting edge, no ML, etc. But we lead our industry. How's this happen/change?","I've seen people saying that they work with ""blockchain"", but their ""blockchain"" was actually an Excel spreadsheet they manually updated.

Are there ""cutting edge"" ml-related things you believe you could do that would increase the value of the product more than it would increase the cost to do it? If so, propose it to your manager. But my suspicion is there isn't, and that's the case with the vast majority of products.


Honestly just think about the things you buy. Say you're in the market for a new phone. One phone costs $500 and another costs $700. They have very similar features, but the more expensive one brags it used advanced ml/ai. If you're anything like me, my first question would be ok what's the ml/ai do, and is what it does worth $200. And maybe what it does is worth it. Maybe the phone uses ml/ai to optimize battery usage and has double the battery life of the cheaper phone. In that case I might get it, but the reason has to do with the longer battery life not the cutting edge method. The cutting edge stuff is the tool not the product. And if you can't use that tool to generate a more valuable product, there's no reason to use it.","There is a lot more to success than squeezing out a low error rate from your models. Your company might just be good at solving problems end to end.

Desirability: Enabling your downstream to use your output, driving adoption, can easily add more value than that reduction in error.

Feasibility: Formulating your problem in a way where you solve easy problems with models rather than solve hard problems with models is worth more than using the latest model architecture. And solving problem formulations where a medium sized error is just fine is much easier than solving problems where errors can't be tolerated.

Viability: Solving problems that derive their value from big cash streams makes you more money than making perfect bleeding edge solutions for small cash streams."

The tricky thing is getting offers that pay a big enough bump and good benefits to make going through interview gauntlet worthwhile.,"This is a data science sub so you are getting visceral, projection-based responses.

I am a hiring manager and I can tell you that i am getting 10x the number of applicants I was a few years ago. Additionally, I am seeing tons of posts on reddit with regard to the struggle. So anecdotally yes.

Possible reasons:

* The data science title is inflated - way to many people that do some ML and think they are data scientists - they are just analysts.
* Unwilling to apply to lower jobs
* Few orgs need real data scientists. Most do not have the data nor the business acumen to utilize them correctly."
11-07-2023,109,Hiring managers: is there a reason for an IC-level Data Analyst/Scientist to speak to every level of leadership?,"A few reasons for so many interviews. 

* Everyone you speak with is a potential stakeholder (order giver) and wants to assess your willingness to create and manage deliverables. 
* Having more people involved gives the appearance of a democratic process where everyone has input and decision-making authority.
* The highest ranking person you speak with likely controls the budget for the position and wants to ""kick the tires"" before deciding","Two reasons why you're seeing this:

**This is how it's always been done**, and it's how it's still done in most teams/functions that are older. I think it has generally been anchored on a couple of ideas. 

Firstly, that leaders set and enforce the team culture, and keeping them in the loop allows them to have a present voice  in ensuring that culture is maintained. That sounds good on paper, but in practice it tends to give too much weight to people who are good at shmoozing important people. 

Secondly, that a Director/VP/etc. got there by being really good at the job that they're not hiring for at some stage. Which used to often be somewhat true, but with DS leadership often not being careers DSs themselves, this is really, really not true.

**There are some people who believe that an optimal hiring philosophy is that your bar should always be high.** One way I've heard  it phrased is that every person in an interview process should be looking for reasons to say ""no"" to a candidate. If no one can, then you hire them. 

Now, this isn't just randos with opinions - I've heard this from people who I very much respect. So there may be something to it - i.e., making the application process easier for the candidate comes at a higher risk of hiring someone who isn't very good, which is one of the most expensive mistakes you can make as a hiring manager.

Personally, I agree with you - I think  that generally speaking there isn't a ton of value in including people in the interview process who are more than 2 levels removed from the role they're hiring for. So if I am hiring for a role, I like to have myself, my boss, and 2 peers interview them. If one of my directs was hiring someone, I'd like to have them, myself, and two of my skip reports interview them.","A couple things:  


Firstly, if the execs are rude or aloof then I'd consider it a mercy to discover that before you accept a job working for them. That's great to learn, and lucky for you, you aren't stuck with bad leaders.

Secondly, why do you get thrown off in these interviews? What is it that makes it go poorly? Work on improving those conversations and it sounds like you'll solve the last piece of the puzzle to landing a new role."
04-07-2023,111,How to stay relevant in the field?,"Depends on where you want your career to go.

Bar none, the most marketable skill is to figure out how to do the technical thing and then make a dollar with it. Implementing stuff and making dollars (e.g. raising revenues, efficiencies, or whatever else) is difficult to train people how to do - so learn that.

Imagine for a minute three scenarios:

- An ATS cuts this number down first. Computers have their flaws related to this task and the false negative rate is probably less than ideal.

- A recruiter with a shallow understanding of data spends 10s filtering them down to a manageable number rather than using an ATS. That's not doing most of the resumes any justice. Even if it improves signal over an ATS. It's still an outrageous amount to achieve pretty mediocre results. 

- A trivial data question is slapped onto an application to cut off 70% of the applicants, to only those that want to write or ChatGPT their way to a quick answer (I highly doubt anyone even checks your response) after which a recruiter can spend more time reading each of the remaining.

None of these is going to give great signal, but the reality is, this isn't designed to give signal, it's designed to prevent a recruiter from drowning, even if imperfectly done. For better or worse, the market is insane right now.",Unbelievable,"Obviously, the link to your solution is Chat GPT."

So far I haven’t had a recruiter bat their eye and ask why I did just do stats/CS instead of DS. 

If you’re getting the programming experience you need in physics, then great stay with it, otherwise if you KNOW you want to do data science then I see no harm in pivoting.","Undergrad degrees should \*not\* be too specific. Choose a hard science that emphasizes math and go with it. You can drill down for a masters or doctorate, but it keeps your options open if you still broad.","I did an undergraduate in DS & A.I and I feel that I had a very successful career so far. Went straight to mid-senior positions in projects, got paid well and never had to do an unpaid/low-paid internship. Never bothered to do a Masters afterwards because we covered almost everything that would have been taught in those already in the B.S.c. It would really only make sense to also do the masters if I’d go more into research.

I’ve studied at Maastricht University btw. The program included a third of typical CS courses, a third of mathematics courses with focus on statistics, combinatorics, modeling and optimization, and a third on DS & A.I specific courses such as Intro to ML, NLP and Data Analysis. 
Had loads of projects work and research projects at the university lab, so it felt like I already had work experience when graduating.

It was the best decision I could have done. I am certain that doing a CS degree, statistics or applied math would have either put me on a different path or less well prepared for a career as a data scientist or ml engineer.

One thing that is unique to all time series - if you’re including covariates you will need to deal with forecasting unknown covariates into the future on top of your dependent variable.  You are either counting on the effect of covariate at time “t” to echo well into the future or you are forecasting your covariate, introducing a new layer of error.

That is why the kitchen sink “all relevant features” approach really does not work in this context.","What do you mean by ai-powered? I think you just mean machine learning.

Pros:
- DEs can have a more accurate understanding of the requirements when building pipelines for ML, such as a feature store
- DSs get their data faster

Cons:
- May result in inconsistent practices in managing cloud infrastructure and security from the rest of the eng team, resulting in ML services to be less reliable or secure than the rest of the applications
- Harder to leverage on the existing DevOps system designed by the eng team 
- DE also have the responsibility to maintain data lakes for BI and analytics team, not just for the DS


Ultimately, DE are engineers, so they need to adhere to consistent engineering practices as the rest of the tech organization.

you just want to detect a “spike”? do you have a sense for what a “spike” means to you?

one obvious think would be like “a spike is when my time series is suddenly a lot higher then before”. then you could just have some sort of moving average — say, over the last 20 time steps — and alert whenever the current time step is more then XX% above that moving average. or, if you want to smooth the measurement, have a slow moving average (say, 20 time steps) and a fast moving average (say, 3 time steps) and alert whenever the fast average is more then XX% above the slow one.

Another simple option you mentioned is modeling the last N time steps as a gaussian and alerting with a standard dev threshold.

how seasonal is your data? how cyclical is it? how complicated is it’s movement? how quickly do you want to throw an alert? what kind of precision/recall trade off do you want to make? do you have any ground truth?

answers to the above will push you towards certain modeling approaches.","1) Aggregate the data to the time granularity approximating the length of the effect you want to measure

2) Forecast the time series one time step at a time N points ahead with some model that probably needs to include seasonality/holidays, so you will have a collection of forecasts & actuals for the whole series.

3) Compute some metric of spread of forecast-actual, e.g. standard deviation, median absolute deviation, etc.

4) Look at the distribution, define a threshold above which there is an anomaly.

5) Report the anomalies.

6) (optional, treat with care) Remove the anomalies from the past history by interpolating with your forecast model.",Just use z-score and see if it works for you. No need to be fancy from the start. It basically tells you how much you deviate from the mean in terms of standard deviation.

What should I do?,"If you got hired, you know enough.",Learning by immersion is the way the world actually works.,People understand that you may not know enough today. Don’t be afraid to ask questions and learn about things that seem confusing. People understand there’s a learning curve that takes years.
28-05-2023,94,I worked in DS jobs closely connected to business but I strongly dislike that and want to work in more technical jobs. What are some areas I could explore? And how to transition?,I’m in this type of role. Check out ag and pharma. But most of us have PhDs and nearly everyone has a MS.,"Lots of big companies will have a center of excellence (COE) that does some applied research into areas of ML or stats or MLE that are of interest to the company.

07-03-2023,99,Should working in DS be this boring?,Rock bands play the same songs every night. Every job is boring after a while.,"Two things could be happening here, one good, one bad.

1) Your model is important and addressing a necessary use case.  People like it the way it is and want you to just keep the lights on.  If it wasn't important then no one would care about maintainence.  That's good.

2) Your company isn't finding other uses for data science that would compel them to move you to a new project.  That's bad, but...honestly, pretty normal.

I think you are actually in a very common situation: companies that do have some use for a few baseline data science models, but don't see it as a competitive advantage that requires constant new investment.","The more code you write the more you have to maintain… most of my job ends up being small weekly tasks because i automated everything.

Just need to know whether this problem statement is solvable or not.,"There’s lots of short-hand in your post, so you’ll have to excuse us if we don’t understand your objective. I do think this is a good post, because it is very indicative of a typical task in DS that is not directly related to ML.

Imo your ground truth variable should be whether the customer broke, lost, or otherwise damaged the rental goods, and the dollar value of the damage. Use their credit score and other explanatory variables to train a model predicting the probability that a customer will break their rental items. That prediction, along with your rental pricing, will predict whether the rental will be profitable or not. Risky, but potentially profitable cases can be forwarded for manual review.

On an additional note, it would be good to explore whether the manual review is better at predicting rental item damage than your model.

Just some thoughts. I’m curious to hear if anyone has experience with something similar.","I think there’s a missing step, I think a model ought to be able to predict the probability of a loss above some dollar value based on the data given, but then it’s business logic how that should be mapped to a maximum allowed sourcing cost. 

I’d consider reframing it as an exercise to predict the probability of a loss exceeding $X, and then it’s up to the business to set the probability threshold for manual review to achieve a target rate - if the target is to review eg. the top 5% highest risk orders, I imagine it should be straightforward to calculate the threshold given your model estimates of loss probability",This sub needs more posts like this!

21-03-2023,92,Got asked to calculate the p-value during an interview. How would you responded?,Everyone saying “decline because low sample size” is wrong.  If this is a binomial distribution then they want you to calculate an exact p-value.  You can do this by summing over the appropriate values using the binomial PDF formula.,"You have enough to know the empirical distribution. I assume you saw 9 or 10 successes or failures with a null hypothesis of 50/50. P(10 successes) = P(10 failures) = 1/1024 (2^10 ). P(9 successes = P(9 failures) = 10/1024). So if you saw 9 successes, the probability of getting a result at least that extreme under the null hypothesis is 22/1024 or about 2% so you have a p value of 0.02. You could work it out 8 or 2 but that starts to get unreasonable to work out in your head

Great step to becoming a great manager!",Ask questions that apply to the projects you’re planning on completing. DS has a huge range of skills and you don’t need a computer vision specialist to build a forecast.,The advice here is absolutely terrible. DS consultant? Look at employees who have published papers? Avoid the diversity hire? Jeez.  Talk to your HR. But practically speaking you don’t need phd level experience. College level or masters level DS and or ML is what you need.

30-05-2023,96,Why would one write a data ETL pipeline in Javascript + SQL?,"PS. You don’t have to understand all the JavaScript. It’s more important to see the current inputs and outputs, design a better system to deliver that, and regression test it against the old system for given test cases, to make sure you’re not missing anything. Then you can improve it from there.","My entire ETL is MSFT SQL.  Maybe what you are working on needs to be SQL.  What specifically is the JavaScript doing that SQL can’t do?  

Who hired the person who wrote the JavaScript?  That person, the hiring manager, needs to weigh in on this, in general you are accountable for the results of the people you hire and if they hired you, with no JavaScript experience, to manage JavaScript that is in the critical path of getting results to paying clients, well that hiring manager needs to help solve the mess that their hiring and failure to retain talent created.","Why’d they write it in JavaScript?

Probably cause they knew javascript (or were willing to learn) and needed to automate the pulling and cleaning of the data. And almost certainly weren’t actually a data scientist/data analyst/data engineer/programmer. 

Javascript isn’t bad, all told. This process will help you when you run into your first access database written in VBA.

However if you want to get into analytics or Data engineering or the new jobs that have been coming up lately such as Business Intelligence Engineering or Analytics engineering which are a mix of Analysis and DE you can absolutely get into that with an online degree and courses, it will obviously be harder without a proper tech or business degree but a lot easier than getting into DS.

26-05-2023,91,Should I relocate for first job?,"Since you are a new grad, my advice would be to move somewhere else for a couple of years. A lot of people never experience living alone and learning to be more independent. Of course, I don't know the specific health condition of your parent and what might be needed; it might make perfect sense to choose to stay. But as a general life advice, I believe it is good for most people to experience being away for a while.","As stated by another user, you need give clear weights to the two options: staying versus leaving. Nobody else can really answer the question for you since your reasons for staying are strictly personal and don’t have high weight from a career and financial perspective (especially if you live in a small town without much opportunity). Consider the likelihood of finding a similar job if you stay (remote or in-person close to where you want to stay), how happy you’ll be in place versus the other, and if staying in your home state is truly the best option for things you’ve mentioned. I personally am very pro-explore. You’re young and have probably lived a fairly sheltered life up to this point based on your reasons for wanting to stay. My vote would be take the great offer right out of school, explore a new big city, and see if it is the life you want. Living in the same place forever seems boring and uneventful to me. You can always move back, but you might be wondering for a while what would have come from taking the leap into new territory if you decide to turn down the opportunity.","Do you live in a major global city, the type of city where it's realistic to work a full career in Data Science, with opportunities for growth and a large number of different companies you can potentially work for? Or, alternatively, do you love your hometown so much that you'd be willing to sacrifice career progression in order to stay there? That's pretty much all it comes down to. I think it's a bit insane for a new grad to turn down a solid entry level opportunity in this market because they want to stay close to their parents, but everyone has different values."
15-04-2023,97,DS teams and daily standups?,"If you have daily deliverables or a lot of dependencies among your team, then a standup makes sense.

08-09-2023,94,Mistake to bring up preference for ML during interview?,"No, it isn't a mistake. If you have expectations, it is better to ask them and not get the job than not to speak about them and suffer from unfulfilling and non-relevant tasks.","It wasn't a mistake. Maybe there were more tactful ways of asking. Rather than framing it ""Do you have a DE team that handles the DE"" or ""Does your team have a heavy focus on data engineering"" you can focus on the ML and ask what they do, what does productionisation look like, how do they build data pipelines etc... Open questions that don't reveal your personal stance but give you the information you need.

It's very fair to also ask what your role in the team would be, what kinds of tasks and problems would you be solving in the first 6 months. Would you working on smaller tasks or owning an area etc...","To add to the other answers, I like to ask them the question ""what does an ideal applicant looks like"" for this role or ""whats the expected day to day of this role""

29-07-2023,92,Got betrayed by the company for visa sponsorship,"Did you get this in writing at all? As part of the job offer or communications with your boss before they left?

I would assume your legal department would be aware of a potential visa sponsorship. Either way, you might be best posting in /r/LegalAdviceUK","In the UK, if companies want to sponsor someone, they have to apply for a licence https://www.gov.uk/uk-visa-sponsorship-employers
and there are some criteria (you need to be a skilled worker, for example https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/workers-and-temporary-workers-sponsor-a-skilled-worker).

Companies do not care about anyone, all they care is profit. If they need you, they will do anything to keep you, until they don't need you anymore. Hard truth.

My best advice for you is to look for other jobs where visa sponsorship is available. Universities usually sponsor your visa (jobs).
It is not easy since you only have a few months left. Start now, send out 100 applications, you might get 10 interviews and land 1 job.

Worst case, apply for a 1 year Master course if you still want to live in the UK.

Good luck!","Have you considered the Netherlands? Many professionals can get a highly skilled migrant visa from companies here, and they are willing to hire foreign English-speaking talents."
15-05-2023,92,Can I survive in Data science with a speech impediment??,"Yes, and don't let anyone fucking tell you otherwise.","I'm a data analyst with a bit of a stutter and speech impediment. 

In my experience you will be fine. Verbal communication with clients, stakeholders, and other data professionals is a very important part of the job but for me it's only about 10% of my time. 

Though for data engineers it's probably closer to 5% in my experience. 

However, your results may vary depending on the firm and the project. I have a senior analyst I work with who is in meetings probably close to 40-50% of their time but they function more as a project manager than data analyst at times.

Another advanced senior analyst I work with (essentially a data scientist) probably spends about 20-30% of their time in meetings, but  my team also does a lot of business strategy work so communication with old guard managers is a bit higher priority. 

That all being said, if your speech impediment is as harmful to your well being and career aspirations as it seems, working on that should be a priority. Even if you get a job that requires you to talk 0% of the time you still have to go out in the world and talk to people.","The stutter is absolutely something you can overcome. One of the product management directors I work for has a very real speech impediment and I watched him crush a product release this year. I'm pretty sure his total comp is well over $600k. Moreover, product management is much more appearance based than DS.

Don't look for examples to get started. Just do it. I'm an African American data scientist at a FANG. Haven't been in a meeting with another black guy in over 2 years. Just do it. Be the pathfinder that the next person with a speech impediment can look up to. Godspeed 🚀"
09-01-2023,89,Quant Finance vs Data Science in 2023,"The one that you enjoy. Both fields have well above average comp and future prospects.  

If you don't enjoy or at least tolerate the work no amount of money or perks will make you happy.

I will say that finance has a very particular culture, and if you aren't down with that culture you will not have a good time.",Quant finance definitely pays incredibly well. Some downsides: a very prestigious job companies typically want top programs/top universities. So it’s much tougher not impossible to break into it without a target school. Eat what you kill in a sense. Depending on the company and dynamic you could be axed if your not producing alpha which can be stressful. The domain knowledge in quant finance is pretty industry specific compared to other tech/stem/math positions. If you go to a target school I would most definitely pursue positions in quant finance. But the risk of not breaking in definitely increase as school rank increases. Which is unfortunate but a reality. You still could break in but statistically more are breaking in at higher ranked unis in proportion. If you ever get a quant offer take it in a heart beat.,"I'll be blunt, I have worked as a quant dev in the past (before pivoting to software engineering). If you have a strong computer science background, don't bother with quant. Go straight to data science.

The best quants i have met all had a PhD in physics or maths or finance"

27-02-2023,92,How long did it take you to fundamentally understand ML algorithms?,"With a degree in math and a MS in Analytics, plus 10 years in DS and 5 in DL, I can say this:

ML/DL math is complex and at times hard to digest but by no means a requirement to apply ML/DL successfully. 

If you were to be a contributer (coder) to libraries, say Scikit-Learn, than you better truly ""know"" the math. But to use and apply it successfully you need only have a strong understanding of fundamentals, not deep theoretical algorithm decomposition, et. al.",">I am worried that I won't be able to fully internalize all of these proofs and derivations before the job search.

I will never ask you to do this in an interview. It is important you know what's going on inside the models so you know whether applying it to a problem is appropriate or not. If you're working tabular data, let's face it -- you're drawing lines through points in space -- sure, it's multidimensional space and your line is some sort of hyperplane or whatever, but you get the point. Understanding enough of the model to explain it to someone else is a good standard, imo.

Get through your coursework, start working. On the job you'll always have access to this nifty thing called ""the internet"", where you can refresh your understanding, as needed.","How much mathematical background do you have?  Do you find the mathematics itself hard (vector calculus, linear algebra, optimization) or is the specific content?  If it's the first, then you need to work on that quickly, but if it's the second it's not so abnormal to feel as you do.

I think it's not needed to internalize the proofs and derivations but you should internalize the concepts of the models, the setting and why the algorithms work, and when they don't.

I remember understanding some of my undergraduate classes a few months after they ended.

I was doing physics research with algorithm creation for some time before I moved to DS so it wasn't a big difference.  You learn much more by doing where you learn one technique inside and out for your particular problem, and then you learn others as ancillaries as you follow references or just get curious.

The EM/GMM isn't actually all that difficult when you program it concretely.

Can you explain concretely what's happening in a simple example?   Like this level is good enough: 

""A: OK so we already know how to fit one Gaussian to data, but now we need to fit a few different Gaussians because we think there are multiple blobs. (use dry erase to make dots on whiteboard).

So now we pretend each data point has a switch between which blob it belongs to, like blob 1 or blob 2 or blob 3.  But it's hidden so we have to make guesses. We make a weighting array for all the possibilities, one per point. These sum up to 1 and are nonnegative.

E stage is guessing the the selection for each point.  We use the existing gaussian parameters and we figure out the probability of the point under those gaussians with bayes rule.  This gives the relative weights of being in 'blob 1' 'blob 2' and 'blob 3'.   When you're done, re-estimate the gaussians having now had a candidate assigment of the points in to the various groups in a weight fraction.  This is fitting Gaussian mean and variance with a weighting for each point, the weighting given by the previous estimation.  Now go back again and re-estimate the hidden choice for each point.  This should converge on a fixed assignment and then you're done.""

""Q: Why do we need to do this?""

""A: because we don't know how to fit both of them at the same time but each individual problem is easy if you keep the other parts fixed""

""Q: So what do you get out of it?""

""A: Two things: an estimate of the probability density, and estimate of which group each point belongs to, like by taking the highest weighting for each point."" 
Mathematical notation makes it obscure but the idea isn't obscure if made concrete.  Like this requires some puzzling over if you first read it (and don't know what's happening):  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EM_algorithm_and_GMM_model

The basic idea of iterative algorithms which switch between two different phases is common, it happens when simultaneous estimation can't be done but each subproblem can be done."

03-06-2023,92,Please suggest resources for understanding Bayesian Statistical Inference and theory & application of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC),"Sure, here you are
https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDcUM9US4XdPz-KxHM4XHt7uUVGWWVSus"," Bayesian Data Analysis, Gelman","Biggest thing is what is your background? Stats PhD, CS undergrad, a DS Masters? That will inform very heavily what to recommend. Andrew Gelman’s book is made for applied math/physics/stats PhD students. It is very dense and technical and has a ton of math and stats in it. If you don’t have a grad degree I would not recommend the book, especially if you have never formally taken a Bayesian class at the upper undergrad level or grad level before.

Personally I would start with something simpler, I really like A First Course in Bayesian Statistical Methods (this has R code in it which is awesome and has chapters with MCMC), A Students Guide to Bayesian Statistics and Bayesian Statistics for Beginners: a step-by-step approach. You need to actually understand the Bayesian processes before doing simulations other wise your not going to be able to generate anything interesting in my experience. 

Hope this helps!"
11-08-2023,90,Whats your approach when it comes to decide whether or not eliminate variables from a dataset?,"A highly unbalanced binary feature might still be very useful for a model. For example, if you were predicting how much a person spends on healthcare each month, knowing if someone has cancer would still greatly affect the output, even though very few people have cancer. 

There’s lots of different ways to do feature selection, and it really depends on what final model you pick. 

One interesting idea I’ve seen is to append a random continuous (normal) and categorical (bernoulli) feature to a dataset, train the model, and remove all categorical features that did worse than the Bernoulli, and remove all continuous features that did worse than the normal.

But the end goal of any feature selection process is to be able to say, “I was able to decrease the number of features from x to y without greatly decreasing the accuracy of the model”","One note: you mentioned your data is related to manufacturing. Make sure your categorical variables aren't confounded with the manufacturing process and/or item of analysis. Otherwise you run the risk of artificially declaring something is significant when in actuality it's just a defining characteristic of the product.

You don't want to be reviewing your findings with SMEs only for them to point out that variables XYZ are only associated with a single product.

All said, depending on your exact problem what you might need is a series of designed experiments rather than EDA.","I was taught to start from nothing then build. Only add a variable if it contributes something. Don’t add everything then delete things that contribute nothing. You end up with a lot of weak variables which generate noise. Also, simpler models are easier to put into action. If you’re trying to maximize revenue it’s easier to tell the business if we change one thing we will see a 20% increase vs we need to change five things to get a 25% increase."
06-07-2023,90,"In my view as a hiring manager, years of experience are a proxy for understanding if you can do the job. This is a noisy signal though. What alternatives do you propose?","I generally get people to talk about their projects and ask probing questions. If they can't explain their work to me, how can I trust them to take their own work seriously.","You ask questions that gauge a person’s curiosity, willingness to learn, and their current skill level. Brief take-home assignments can work too. 

In this field, there are no perfect candidates. Work from one company to another can be incredibly different, so experience as you say is not always a perfect proxy. 

You need to find people who have both a solid _foundation_ and an eagerness to learn new things.","If someone has held a DS position for at least a few years before, it's usually safe to say they can code well enough to follow a Deep Learning tutorial, if you really needed them to just blindly implement a model.

I think what I look for most is investigative ability, and ability to think critically about a problem. The most effective interview I've been on the receiving end has been when I was verbally given a very open-ended description of a problem, and asked how I would solve it. I think it's a waste of time to probe about things like ""wait do you know what a Type 1 error is?"" when it takes two seconds to Google. We're hiring DSs because they can leverage data to solve business problems. Present them with a problem, and watch how their wheels start to turn. Someone who has no experience might just start listing the usual steps ""well first I'll do some EDA, and then I'll fit a linear model...."" but someone with more experience probably pauses to ask questions, to understand the scope, to talk about the numerous approaches they'd do depending on the specifics, ask what kind of baselines there are, what constraints there are, etc."
25-08-2023,90,Is it ok to use an offer to negotiate a pay rise?,Only use offers as a negotiating chip if you're willing to walk,"You can either : 

1. Use the two projects you've delivered and the quality of your work as an argument for a raise, at worst your boss  will say no and they would have no reason to get pissed. 
2. Use the other offers as argument, this is obviously the nuclear option. Be prepared to leave in this case because if your boss says no then it makes no sense to stay. Of course if you go this route, you will need to phrase it in a way that emphasizes how much you like your job and that you'd be very sad to leave.

As a general rule, you're either learning or earning. If you're really learning a lot in this job you can afford to stay a few more months until you find an ideal alternative (without commute etc).","It depends on what you want to achieve. 

If you want to stay *and* get paid more, and if you trust them well enough;
* book a meeting with your boss to discuss your 12 month review
* discuss your successes and your future plans with the company
* let them know that recruiters have reached out with 70k offers *but you think the businesses sound kind of shit*. I can't stress this enough. 
* ask them what you'd need to achieve to see that kind of money when your 12 month review comes around

22-07-2023,88,"Explain ""Confidence Interval"" In a way that even a 7 year old or even a golden retriever can understand !",Confidence interval are the locations you can usually find your doggie toys,Bark bark aarf aarf,"Any time we calculate a number, like a batting average, it is based on limited data that are available at a point in time.   If a coach wants to select the player with the best batting average to be the lead off hitter, that is a good strategy, but it is not a guarantee that the batter is really the best one to lead off — maybe that batter just got lucky a few times, or that batter faced pitchers who were easy to get hits off of. 

The confidence interval is a range around the batting average.  The range gets smaller as you get more information, so you are more certain that a batter really has the best batting average late in a season versus after the first game.  Also, the more you use statistics to account for other factors like the skill of the pitcher, the narrower you can get the confidence interval to be.

As information increases, you become more confident in your estimate of every batter’s batting average."

I worked for two of the largest ad agencies where it was harder to inform all the stakeholders about changes in circumstances because of all the momentum driving projects and campaigns. I spent two years working for the owned-stations group of a TV network trying to convince sales reps to focus more on what drives planning decisions. There is no such thing as a golden sales deck.

The part of a Data scientist job that chatGPT can do is writing the code to model the data. Which is the easiest part and it's already wrapped up in libraries. 

In a 2 month project I probably spend 3 hours writing code to model the data. With chatGPT that might be cut down to 30 minutes? The rest is data analysis, cleaning and understanding the project and requirements. 

Not really much of a time saver.","The fact that a person works in data science doesn’t give him expertise in socio-economic consequences of robotic revolution and automation.

For that you need to go to qualified people - historians, economists, sociologist etc. A dude that cleans data in Python has no idea what will happen to society because of automation.

As for the industry, again, hard to say. In 1990ies you had to have a whole TV channel to produce content that can be seen by millions. Nowadays a dude with an iPhone 7 and a bit of charisma can produce such content. Did it kill news anchor profession? Of course not, it gave an opportunity for thousands more to be those anchors and produce media tailored to very specific audience, which was impossible in the 90ies.

Probably GAI will kill certain professions and changes others, but it will also open the gates for many more applications that were impractical before, but totally make sense when DA is easy and cheap.","Labor economist here.

Bottom line: no one knows.

On the one hand, automation will mean that we need fewer data analysts/engineers/scientists doing the work that we're currently doing right now. So from that perspective, there will likely be a reduction in employment. This is what economists call a direct or a ""first order"" effect.

However, AI will also grow the economy. So there could be indirect or ""second order"" effects. It could be the case that everyone winds up with a small slice of a bigger pie, in which case it's welfare improving. I'm not including consideration of a UBI, but that could become politically viable at some point, but that's a different discussion. 

Anyway, econometric methods are pretty good at identifying first order effects. Second order effects are more challenging to estimate/project. Most economic models lend themselves to partial equilibrium analysis (i.e., take a partial derivative while holding everything else constant). But with a disruption/shock as profound as the AI singularity, you need a general equilibrium analysis because pretty much everything will be simultaneously affected. Ironically, the only way to do this well might be via an agent-based model that leverages AI. 

In any event, if I were new to the field, I don't think the right question is ""Will AI make me obsolete in 10 years?"" Rather, the question is how will AI change the nature of the work of data analysis/engineering/science and how can I leverage it to be more productive?"
15-05-2023,84,Advice for director of data science,"There are two options. 
1. Upskill and guide team in technical discussions.
2. Focus more on people management and team building. Hire some good technical managers who can look at technical stuff. But set your boundaries. If you think your IC skills are rusty, please don't try to jump too deep in any technical discussion with your teams. You will be laughed at. 

Speaking from previous experience as most data science directors I have worked with were fake. They moved from engineering to data science, but faked past n years of experience as data science experience and proclaimed they know many things in data science. In just a single session, you get judged by your junior and it decides the respect you will command from your team. I have also seen many directors who know their limit and try to work accordingly by focusing on people management and team building. It all boils down to playing to your strength.

Now given that you have a PhD, you can use your skills in problem scoping, problem validation, solution prototyping, data science theory etc and guide your team and leave the work on tools like python, AWS etc. to your team. Maybe you can pick some one promising in your team, guide and fastrack them which in the long run can help the team.","I'm a head of data science and understand your issue here. However I'd try and focus on what you need to achieve and then go from there to find the best route.

Firstly obviously there's no harm in up skilling yourself, but is this the fastest/best route to what you want to achieve? Your team will learn very quickly given the opportunity, and I expect you bring a huge amount of experience regardless of stack to be able to support them.

Personally I'd focus on the best ways to up skill your team; training, projects, secondments, cross company collab? It depends a bit on what they are lacking as a team, is it coding experience, getting models out in production or business knowledge? 

Obviously if you can also argue that your team needs more experience, perhaps you can go down that route.

I think you can affect more here than you're giving yourself credit for.

My other thought in this is my personal belief that LLMs are going to fundamentally change how DS is done, so I'd focus on that more. You might find your junior team is perfectly placed to make the most of it in the near future.","Don't fake it, in my experience that always leads to junior levels not respecting the team lead and a quick change of leadership. Set your team up for success. Encourage them to go to trainings/take online courses and rely on one or more of the junior DS/DEs that show promise and help lead in discussions.

Since you are the leader, you determine what direction/deliverables the team works on and prioritizes but the implementation should be discussed and debated not dictated."

When it comes to listening and understanding, try to focus on the way they perceive the world. We all have a screwy way that we look at the world - identify the differences between your view and their view. This is more conceptual.","Practice — I hate to sound reductive or give an unhelpful answer, but that’s really what did it. After countless meetings, emails, and personal interactions, you learn a bit about what works and what doesn’t.","The most important part of communicating is to tailor your delivery to your audience. A wide vocabulary doesn't mean much, it's often the case that using obscure words makes it harder for others to process your point. When you try to explain why a solution is good/bad, or why something is/is not a problem, frame it within the lens of the other person's work, and what's important to them.

In my experience good Data analysts often become superb data scientists… that’s because they already know the importance and value of analyzing data (something straight out of school DS often fail to realize tending to be myopically focused on modeling). Solid SQL skills, data visualization, and data wrangling which you master as a DA are foundational, but perhaps most importantly is your domain expertise and pragmatic focus on business solutions and value. Stay focused on the value you bring and start acquiring the skills of your new trade... you will succeed","Think of being a Data Scientist like playing a game where tech stuff keeps changing, just like in video games.

Keep being curious and don't be shy to ask others for help, like teaming up with other players. As you keep learning and trying, you'll start feeling more comfortable.

I talk to other friends who have gone into law or medicine, they both had to do a lot more school, and work a lot more than I have to. Then most other careers pay way less and have to work more, with less flexibility. Being paid well and decent work-life balance is the most exciting part of DS.","DS is super versatile.

You can influence business strategy. You can inform R&D decisions. You can do the actual R&D (e.g. algorithms). For me, I like sprinting between projects and learning new things constantly. And as another person said: the work-life balance is nice 😊

At this time, we’re lucky that it’s possible to pivot our careers between types of DS functions. If you don’t like what you’re doing now, do a few side projects, publish to GitHub, take a class - it feels like the possibilities are endless!","I work in tech, which is a bit different than many DS roles.  I don't know if exciting is the right word, but many of the R&D projects I've done over the years have changed the world.

If he has no contractual power to make you stay, then I would take the job and work on it until you can find a better one. 

Yes - employers are getting increasingly frustrated that workers aren't dedicating their entire career to one job. But that is an employer problem - they just aren't doing what they need to do in order to keep people around. Don't let employers bully you into thinking that you owe them something - you work for money and benefits.

I’ve considered quant finance roles in trading firms or hedge funds but this just seems like it will elevate my stress levels for no reason.


I think what I’ve considered is to try and get hired as a DS at a company where I really love the product or brand, and ideally it’d a product I love. For example, I think if you were a DS at a company where the product or service they offer is one you use a lot, then it may help.

For example a buddy of mine was feeling this way so he left his ds job in the insurance industry and got lucky by getting hired at Spotify. He loves music and is a musician himself in his free time so he doesn’t really care if he’s doing boring ds stuff cause he’s working for a company whose product he actually enjoys and is a fan of. He finds that his purpose for DS has grown and he embraced more of the nontechnical product DS roles because it was Spotify and he wanted to try and make the app he uses all the time a lot better.","You should identify why you are burned out. It might not be data science but the companies you worked for (bad work-life balance), the type of DS you do, or it could be how you do it (not good at dealing with stress). If you don't identify why you feel this way, then you might be burned out in a new path.

Ex) Titanic survival classification, MNIST CNN classification,

Class projects are normally great opportunities. I did a ML project in a Bioinformatics class and I have it on my resume

Kaggle is a good resource for clean datasets

The most important aspect about having projects on your resume is as a talking point in an interview. 

The data scientist interviewing you wants to know that you’ve learned more than the .train(), .predict() pattern.

Being able to explain things like 

“I noticed that there was a lot of missing data in my dataset, so I used _____ imputation BECAUSE ________”

“I used ______ feature selection process BECAUSE I wanted to ______”

As long as there is a decent level complexity to them what matters most to me is that you have a good grasp of the work itself and when I ask questions about it we can have an interesting discussion about it. Heck, the last intern we hired (who's now my junior colleague) corrected a faulty assumption of mine that I made about his work, and then we went on to have a nice detailed discussion about it. Which I thought was fantastic!

So, I'd say find a project you know you will enjoy working on and do it thoroughly.","I would recommend you to start by creating a website where you can share your projects. With GitHub Pages is straightforward to do so, and it's also free.

Then I recommend you to do projects that look interesting for you. I don't recommend you doing the typical projects that can be found everywhere (Titanic, forecast stock market, etc.). For example, a project I've been thinking about is to download all you WhatsApp/Telegram messages, and then train a model that predicts the next word. This way you can build a model that speaks like you (I find interesting to chat with yourself). But this is only one example, I recommend you to think which problem you would like to see solved and then do it yourself. 

Also, I recommend you to not only focus on the machine learning part. I would try to build a project that seems like a real project (data pipelines, data storage, data cleaning, CI/CD, automatize everything, VCS, etc.)"

Just take a breath, you got this. 

Remember that on average it takes several months before an employee becomes “fully” as productive as most companies expect, and they know this. It takes time to familiarize yourself with their systems. This might be my ego talking, but I believe that academics excel at learning things quickly, so even if you feel like you’re off to a slow start and you’re not contributing for the first few weeks, chances are your manager will feel like you’re blazing ahead of pace.

And speaking of pace, expect a much quicker pace for things. In academia if I plotted a line of best fit to some data I had to be ready with a dozen slides talking about where the data came from, how I cleaned it, what my hypothesis was, how I fit the data, etc etc, basically the whole scientific method. In industry if I say “hey this model looks like we could improve X by Y%” then someone asks me if I’m sure, and then a decision is made. No paper is written up, no conferences to spread the word, just a few questions about how sure you are, and then the information/decision is handed off to someone else. This probably varies based on the size of your company and the impact of the decision being made, but I have a hard time imagining any company moves slower than the life cycle of writing a proposal, being selected, performing the experiment, writing up the analysis, getting feedback, following up/repeating the experiment, publishing, and going to conferences involved in academia.","Be patient and open to learning the various systems that organizations use.

But I would be careful otherwise as it might not be well received from those that have other responsibilities.","Being the first data scientist isn't ideal which I can vouch for from personal experience, assuming this is your first job. So for your personal growth I would say gain some experience then switch as soon as you can to some place where you can learn. 

These are some of my suggestions: 

- Do you have a solid data warehousing practice in place?  If you do make sure you have direct access to them so that you don't have to go through someone/dept. Otherwise you'll very likely be caught up at the data gathering stage.

- Do you have any reporting/BI team/colleague? If not then it's probably better approach to start with reporting and dashboard. If your business users aren't comfortable with basic reports/dashboards then your models won't most likely produce any impact. 

- Are you comfortable working with web app packages such as Dash, Streamlit, Shiny? in smaller orgs you can create a lot of value  by building web apps to do data manipulation, report automation, simple model/calculation updates etc. I would recommend Shiny + Posit connect subscription. Posit connect will cost some money but that's the quickest way to get value with the lowest effort.

Edit: Training workers isn't worth it unless you are asked to do so. Rather focus on high visibility and high impact projects.","The reason they're asking you to fulfill these requests isn't because they don't know how (though they may not), it's because it frees up their time to do other things. That's what they hired you for.

You should be thoughtful about creating reports and visualizations that serve the needs of your users while using your own time effectively, e.g., by creating dashboards that update automatically or by automatically emailing reports on a daily/weekly/monthly basis.

Generally, I believe a short, succinct, role-relevant test is an important thing for employers to use. If they are scored systematically and in a manner blind to the applicant's name, age, gender, race/nationality, and background, they even become a boon for equity.

06-02-2023,82,How bad is your Company Data?,"The best story I have is one of malicious compliance. 

Employees were asked to self-report task time. Over the course of the 2 year sample size. It was the most consistent data I had ever seen in my life. All the employees (in their own ways) were logging the exact same times every day. It was some of the tightest clusters I’ve ever seen statistically which shocked me because for self reported I expected it to be all over the map. No person ever had a single time entry over 1 standard deviation from their mean. 

In this case the data was so good that it was bad.","A lot of companys’ data infrastructure is like this unfortunately, even in FAANG. The problem in general from what I’ve seen is that Data Engineering is both often silo’ed away from Data Science and also seen as a cost center rather than a profit center. So in many cases the people responsible for data management both (a) have very little understanding of how the data they’re in charge of is actually supposed to be consumed and (b) aren’t paid enough to care. 

I think about half of my meetings these days as a DS lead is just talking to DE. It’s a lot of back and forth with me desperately trying to figure out why it’s so hard to get simple sales data and them trying to explain to me that they need to update their arcane processes involving 30 different tables with slightly different names with zero documentation explaining the difference.",It takes a lot of effort to setup consistent and stable data pipelines. That’s why data engineerings is such an important part of DS. The analysis is most often the east part. The hard part is getting the data into a matrix or tabular form where you can just hit a button and plot regressions and correlations.
02-06-2023,79,Full Stack Data Science Project Ideas,"So first thing, I think this is a great idea. Understanding the full pipeline is very valuable and a lot of people do the east route of grab a dataset, throw it through some sklearn model, and call it a day. Additionally, you seem to have a pretty good idea of what is involved. 

Now the one thing you’re struggling with is possibly the most important piece of being a good data scientist: the creative curiosity. Forget about trying to use a specific model, that is limiting how you’re thinking about the data. You don’t have to have a topic you’re super interested in. You need to find a problem and then find a solution. Walk through the park and maybe see if you can figure out what a type of plant is. Can you? How can you create a model that does it for you? Regardless of the problem, your story of gathering data will be the most important thing to talk about in an interview, and if you get creative with the gathering of it, you’ll set yourself apart.","There's a lot in [here](https://github.com/awesomedata/awesome-public-datasets); it's a good start.

I really think you should consider that if you want this to be an end-to-end data project, data sourcing and problem framing is INCREDIBLY important. You might want to do some more legwork on what you want to work on and looking at what's out there like in the list above. 

If you're asked in an interview what the motivation of a project was, you never want it to be ""a person on Reddit said it might be good."" You want it to be something you're excited about, and that will help you make a good project too, and stick with it when it's tough.","I am not that great at all you said, I was only good with python and statistics.
I went to the metro station, took a note, a stop watch and started entering and gathering data.

Answering questions that matter to public manner:
1- how many trains can arrive in an interval of 10 minutes
 After I answered that, I got to the point where a Poisson distribution was needed. Since this is a poisson distribution, the next question was:
2- how many minutes between each train arrival given that the arrival rate observed is (lambda)

3- what is the time required for the train to travel from one station to the other.

4-what is the probability that the next train is a fancy one given that the current train is not (a fancy train is a train with air conditioner)

I found interesting information doing this project and I wrote a blog about it and finally telling the story at an interview and it got me a job as an operations analyst.

One thing I would have done If I had your knowledge is creating a simple web app asking the user for stations he’d like to travel from and to and then I calculate the time in minutes he’d probably arrive to his destination using bootstrapping.

The thing is, just try to take out a notebook, get down to the ground, smell problems and try to find a way to fit data to this problem.

Most intense interview was “tell me about a project where you did XYZ” and I spoke to the project vs show them the code","No. The experience you have on the job solving real problems with real data is far more valuable of experience, no one will care about your hypothetical personal stuff.

I would say the only exception would be if you’re trying to land a job that wants experience you haven’t done on the job.

17-04-2023,81,How to work on visualization?,"Start with a question not the data.

If you're just browsing you can use something like pandas profiling. If you really want to do all by yourself just split the data into meaningful chunks and related questions. There is no way you need to see everything at once in the raw form.","I've had this situation quite a bit and this tends to be my workflow:  


1. Think about it. Have some idea of (a) what I expect to see and (b) what I want to get out of the analysis.
2. Correlation plots. See a quick heatmap of correlations.
3. Univariate Plots. Check for linearity and just look at distributions. This can give you some good ideas.
4. PCA/ dimensionality reduction. I'll generally look at loadings on PCA to see if there seem to be underlying latent variables. You may want to transform some of your non-linear data OR use a dimensionality reduction technique that is robust to non-linearity like T-SNE.
5. Start building simple models. Usually I start with some sort of linear model. Obviously this depends on the problem, but it can be nice to take the time to build a simple linear model so you have a interpretable baseline null model. You'd be surprised the number of times you'll neve beat a good linear model.",Echoing Pandas profiling library is really good for that type of early data visualization.
06-03-2023,76,Is ageism a major barrier to hiring in DS roles?,"Short answer: in non toxic companies NO.

Long answer:  Think of companies as dates. It's about finding a match that will appreciate you for what you are. ITS NOT about finding someone that will tolerate your 'flaws'.

I would say it's not a problem unless you make it into one. Be proud of your past experiences. That is a differenciator for you that other candidates cannot offer. Present them as advantage and some will see it from your point of view and the ones that don't see the advantages are just a bad match.

I would always choose a passionate candidate over the one with credentials.","While the ideal would be there’s no ageism, some companies do have ageist mentality. 

Some recruiters do the filtering based on your graduation date in your resume or years of work in you resume and path of growth. 

You can minimize these potential avenues of discrimination by removing graduation date if you have more than 10 years of experience, and if you wish, highlight the experience you gained the past 10-15 years only.

Despite these challenges, don’t let it deter you from applying, and position your capabilities as delivering value for the company.

And 4 years of promotions and savings can add up to a lot that even with the higher starting pay for a phd can take time to make up that opportunity cost.","They can be but it’s not a guarantee. 

At my company, we have 6 levels for Data Scientists and Machine Learning Scientists. Having an advanced degree means you might be considered for a higher level as a new grad, or once you get experience, it might reduce 1-3 years from the YOE you’ll need to be considered for a higher level. 

Additionally, with your research background or depending on what you studied, it could qualify you for niche roles that are hard to fill and this have higher salaries for that reason.","The answer is probably ""yes"", but is likely confounded by a few things.

Data scientists with a PhD are likely in positions which require a PhD, and those positions are likely broader in scope, less well defined, perhaps staff level roles in that case.  The PhD itself is not the sole cause of any increased remuneration, having a PhD is correlated with ~~having~~ being perceived to have skills to succeed in higher paying roles.  

EDIT:  Being a little careful with my language here.  PhDs often do succeed in the roles I've described, but the PhD doesn't give that to you, it just tells people you can do it fairly reliably."

14-07-2023,73,"How do you answer the ""where do you see yourself in 3/5 years"" question?","Usually, folks ask that question to find out where you see yourself headed in the short term. So if you aren't sure you kinda need to figure that part out.

There are two main continuums in most tech type roles - people manager vs. individual contributor and technical vs. business side.

Generally, the technical in data science tends to be deep in research methods, technical details surrounding code and statistical methods, etc. The business side tends to be around dollars whether generated or saved, how to integrate across business functions, and often related to getting an idea into pilot and then into production and it doing what the customer wanted (customers are sometimes internal).

I'd focus your answer around that continuum first. That tends to make the specificity of people manager vs. individual contributor a lot easier. Once you have that answer you can make a quasi-plan and then share that plan with folks when they ask about your career development plan which is what the 3/5 year question is all about.

So you might see yourself as a project implementation person because you can see the big picture and are learning how all the pieces come together. Or your target might be towards a principal data scientist that is a specialist on model development. It really all depends on what you want.

So figure out where you go on those continuums and then figure out how to translate that into typical business speak. If you are very junior you can probably just tell them where on each continuum you want to aim.","In this industry, well do you see yourself going expert career track or management track?

Modeling even tho is what is teach in the courses is not the the majority of the work, it's becoming less and less of a work to model since out of the box models/ packages are performing better and better each day.","Two thoughts:

1. Identify a minimum model based on data cleaning needs. Know that it'll be crummy but the point is to be able to model it. Clean as you go. You don't have to make every field perfect,just the ones you can use.

2. OR focus on writing a few python functions that will do the EDA for you ... Or better yet find some existing packages. EDA is interesting and necessary but writing code for it in pandas or dplyr can be tedious.

Task like fill na , check data type, astype into other data type / merge/pivot/groupby etcetc can ben handled by pandas easily.

* it company: medical chat-bot, video super-resolution, image generation, model conversation for chips, etc

1. Data Scientists with a stronger Software Eng background
2. Data Scientists with a stronger mathematics focus
3. Data Scientists with a lot of domain knowledge

I think in any industry, having people that fit these personas is very valuable. If I was looking to switch industries, I would maybe really focus on the first two points (i.e. technical skills that are less domain-specific) that I can either hone in on or emphasise in my CV or interviews.

As for being pigeonholed, I do not believe at this stage of your career you would be affected by this at all. I would recommend networking and getting to know other Data Scientists in other areas because the main detractor of being in a specific industry can sometimes be that the people you know are also similarly aligned. 

I don't think ""starting over"" is what will happen as you switch but rather you might lose any career progression momentum you have in your current role (although I would argue if you don't like the industry then this is probably a less of a factor to consider unless of course you have other aspirations that might require a higher pay)."

If you're not very senior and you're not close to the domain, I don't know if I'd advise doing an analysis tear down where you compare trends vs the holdout vs the experiment results, unless your manager supports you doing this.

1.) They may only report successful experiments 
2.) These may not really be experiments but marketing initiatives launched via a holdout to track impact

Filter through the buzz - they typically have one division somewhere that does experimental things for the PR campaigns they post on LinkedIn about god-knows-what new deep learning model or use-case.

In another context few years back I used to work for a small consulting company and outmanouvered one of the top 4 consulting companies from our client after writing a report showing how their model is not fit for production despite them having insisted on putting it there. It was a heavily overfitted random forest, trained on 879 examples with 200 variables where 1 variable was responsible for the entire decision making...it was as terrible and as amatourish you can imagine.",McKinsey of Data science consulting is... McKinsey. They have a quantum black division,"Quantum Black, BCG Gamma, McKinsey Digital"
22-02-2023,74,"I had a conversation with a data science hiring manager at a very large firm, and he told me that the DS world is changing rapidly. Here's why.","Don't be the guy digging for gold, be the guy selling the shovel is what I'm getting out of this. Projects fail all the time, but the need for developing and maintaining those pipelines are needed regardless how those projects turn out.","I can see the picture this person is painting, but I haven't seen this materialize the way its being described.

For simplicity, let's divide the world into three factions: analysts, modelers, and engineers. Analysts take numbers and derive insights and action. Modelers take data and create inferential, predictive, prescriptive models based on them. Engineers actually make all of this work in production and at scale. 

Mature organizations have a balance of all three. And any experienced analyst, data scientist and engineer understands that you need all three functions.

Now, if you're in the early stages of DS, then you need to pick your pillar to build around - some companies built around analysts (mostly old Fortune 500 types), some around engineers (mostly tech companies), and some around data science (mostly the heavy stats fields like insurance, risk, credit, etc.). 

So yes - some companies just hired a buttload of engineers with rudimentary stats knowledge. Why? Becuase their top priority wasn't getting a great model - their priority was getting ANY model into production. 

Other companies hired a bunch of modelers and very few of anyone else. Why? Because for them the value was in getting a much better model - even if it meant running it manually in Bob's laptop.

And other companies hired a bunch of analysts. Why? Because for them the real value is to be able to convince their Gen X management layer that they need to use numbers to make decisions.

As all three of these companies mature, they will all reach the stage where they go ""shit, we need to hire some of what we haven't hired thus far"".","This is a sentiment that I also share. I think ""data science"" can sometimes be a no mans lands. There's three key branches:

1) Business Analytics (this role to some extent always existed but is the fundamental work that drives business decisions, it's high level, using the latest BI tools out there these days)

2) ML Research (this not just using ML packages but being able to innovate on existing algorithms, build from scratch, and really have the mathematical background to understand the models you are working with).

3) Data Engineer / ML OPs ; being able to operationalize end-to-end the data applications as well as ETL pipelines that productionalize ML work from 2 and also serve downstream tables for the analyst in 1. With better cloud tools out there, this has become more manageable with a small team. 

Now the ""ideal"" data scientist is able to take on all 3 roles, but in practice, it's hard to find someone who 1) has substantial background in all 3 and 2) is able to work through the 3 roles.  I think it's easy for a data scientists to fall into one of these 3 buckets, though the real selling point of data science in its current form has been that it sits in the intersection of these 3. The problem is you easily will get people 1) slightly familiar with ML packages, but given ease of use, they just apply the packages get some results, but don't have background to verify assumptions 2) maybe don't have the programming skills to build a scalable end-to-end product, and so forth. So you can easily find yourself in ""no mans land"". Data Science is an abstract integration of these 3, but I believe the requirement for one person to embody excellence of all 3 in many cases is unrealistic and unfeasible. A better approach is a ""data science team"" which leverages skills of the individuals in an integrated fashion rather than a ""data scientist"" you may dab in all 3 but not be fully grasping all 3 at once."

2. Getting more data.
3. Removing or altering incorrect data. For example, I've seen image datasets for multi-label classification that simply did not have the object the label said it had or the inverse.
4. Analyzing what mistakes your model is making on the validation set can drive feature engineering.

Don't abuse number 4. If you shuffle validation and test sets after each experiment you are implicitly overfitting on test.

Ideally you write code that splits off your test set and puts it in a folder or adds a label in your DB. Afterwards you need a second function that takes the data you've split off, evaluates your model on it and gives you 1 or a few aggregate metrics. That way your test set is stable and you don't have the ability to craft features specifically to accomodate the test set.",Looking at false positives and false negatives aka error analysis. Like actually pull up the samples and look at them with your eyes.

18-09-2023,70,How do you unravel the mysteries of data?,"I pull out my SciKit, light a small PyTorch, chant ""Aws, aws, aws"", and wait for the Tensor to Flow through me.","Programs, databases, and frameworks are just the tools you use to implement something. More important to learning what you can from data are knowing what data you have, understanding the problem you wish to solve, and domain knowledge of the field you are in. 

Whether you use pytorch/keras, or snowflake/some other database, is unimportant. That's akin to asking which brand of tool you need to fix a car; it's the type of tool that matters

So be able to tell whether a question needs traditional ML, deep learning, visualization, or just a SQL query to answer. And be able to ask questions whose answers will create value

That said, it is important to have competency to be able to use these tools, so now I'll answer that part. I use SKLearn and pytorch for modeling, SQL and spark for data processing, and plotline for data viz.

Tech companies rarely invest in the documentation and processes that allow noobs to get up the learning curve faster.  It becomes a survival of the fittest situation. 

Insurance, pharma, banking, those areas will have more structure, on average.  

Stick with it. And learn who is faster and ask them for code snippets and shortcuts.  Sometimes a few hints is all that is needed.  For example I always tell noobs to undersample, draw 1% of the data, and iterate faster on the things that matter.  Only when you have a true value add result should you pull a data set that takes more than 2 minutes to fit with a modern algorithm like CATBOOST.  Otherwise you waste a lot of time and CPU on non-value add stuff.",">I come away from discussions with requestors not sure of what they want,

You can't do that. I had this problem - I didn't want to be perceived as wasting people's time, but you need to walk away from conversations with not just clarity on what they want, but a clear plan of action as to how you intend to get there.

>and when I'm alone with zero documentation, the abundance of tables, nearly identical fields, and other complexities, I often give up trying to figure things out on my own and go directly to colleagues for direction.

Give up faster. I often find that the mistake people make is spending too much time trying to figure things out on their own instead of asking, finding the answer immediately, and then *knowing* how to do that thing moving forward. Figuring things out on your own in an organization that is large where people already know the answqers isn't the right skillset to develop.

>Typically, my workflow looks something like this:  
  
Review the request.  
  
Meet with the requestor to discuss further.  
  
Explore the data and try to figure things out on my own.  
  
When I get stuck for more than a few hours, I ask my colleagues to point me in the right direction (usually I try looking over different tables/fields, reviewing other analysts working, sitting on things to see if anything clicks).  
  
I power through and continue working on it.  
  
Once I believe I'm in a good place, I request peer review.  
  
Finally, I work on finalizing and delivering the request.

Here is my workflow:

1. Review the request
2. Meet with the requestor to discuss further and identify candidate data sources
3. Reach out to your team and do an initial assessment of ""where would you guys go for this data and do you have any existing code/queries that showcases how to handle it"".
4. Now you power through and work on it for enough time to identify what is getting you stuck.
5. Come up with a concise list of issues that can be answered as easily as possible to get you unstuck, send that list via email and set up a meeting
6. Follow up meeting with whoever and get yourself unstuck, and in the process see if you can validate your approach with them as a sounding board
7. Depending on the size of the project, set up meetings with your boss (short ones) to pressure test the approach you're taking. if it's simple enough you may not need this, but if it's a project that will take more than a month of work, you probably do.
8. Repeat

>My boss has been implying I should definitely be more confident on my own at this point, 

Just so we're clear: this is a statement of where you are right now in terms of knowledge, 

>so I can't help but wonder if he's right and I should be better at figuring things out on my own at this stage. 

This is a statement about the process of how you get there. 

Your boss saying ""you should *know* more by now"" doesn't necessarily mean ""you should be better at figuring things out on your own by now"". It could mean ""you need to be faster at figuring things out *by whatever method you need to implement to do it"".*

I’d argue you can get pretty far by earnestly reading Investopedia and resources like MIT’s OpenCourseWare site that has a lot of full lectures with notes, slides, and sometimes full lecture videos. 

https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/15-401-finance-theory-i-fall-2008/

https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/economy.asp

https://coursera.org/learn/introduction-to-finance-the-basics

To generalize, finance deals with the transportation of value through space and time (I want this house but I can’t afford 300k upfront so I’ll take a loan and pay it overtime along with some interest for the privilege). Why a new fintech would exist is because they’ve found some specialty within this paradigm, or new technology can give you a competitive advantage (read Michael Porter) that other companies couldn’t replicate because of how they’re structured, their size, inability to change quickly, or due to legal requirements barring them from operating in a certain market. 

Economics deals with how we make decisions (as a society, company, or individual) given limited resources (value), so understanding and evaluating trade-offs should come naturally to those with CS experience. I think economics provides a generally useful viewpoint for understanding why a lot of the world works the way it does but I might be biased.

Having an understanding of these can help you see why management employs certain strategies and help you see ways to add value. 

Overall any business’s main goal is to make more money that they spend. Data Science has a lot of tools useful for both minimizing costs or maximizing revenues that are useful in this endeavor (look at econometrics and optimization mathematics)

The model was trained on a dataset of every prospective customer with ones who have interacted with us being marked as True(likely to respond) and everyone else as False. I tried quite a few things like using different models and creating new features, which did improve the performance, but only marginally. My breakthrough came when I realized that the campaign had been running for long enough that we could just train on the subset of people that had been targeted before, thereby accurately creating the False class (not likely to respond) excluding people who had never been targeted. This instantly gave us a significant uplift in the response rate.

However, shortly after we had to reduce funding for the campaign due to budget cuts 🥲","I developed a system that estimated the quality of a 3D scan based on the medical experts scanning ability: acceleration of the scanner, tracking of the body etc. 

After observing medical experts - of varying scanning capability - we found they moved smoothly and uniformly, so we looked at the frequency of changes in acceleration from one second to the next: if there were many changes, worse scan, and if changes in acceleration were smaller, good scan. 

It was really cool because we didn’t even look at the data to design features, they were built from understanding the context and how that maps to the data. It also allowed us to know which features were essential to have in our model: essential movements that could be diagnosed and reported backed to the user.

O(N^3) is absolutely killer for many applications, however, especially because there's no online training algorithm as far as I am aware."

22-02-2023,69,I feel so stressed to keep up withthis fast-paced development of AI & DS,"In so many cases what is the newest thing barely matters, so many project can be done by simple methods. If you are not planning to work in NLP you can ignore NLP and learn it once you need to.",CV and NLP are two different sub fields. If you know both you’re a unicorn. I’ve never used either. I use linear regression and Tree/Forest most of the time. Tree usually works almost as well as forest and uses way less compute in prod.,you cant surf forever and thats okay. Ride a wave you like and ride it well my friend
30-07-2023,66,Trapped in dev job after bait-and-switch,"I interviewed for a DS role after my phd and on the first day they introduced me as “the new backend engineer.” I had take one cs class and it was terrifying, but it gave me valuable skills and when I found my way back to DS a great skill set. Try to embrace it and see what you can learn. Being a great coder is always useful.","Spin it: there's tons of companies who'd love to have a DS with deeper SWE experience. 

Unless you HATE the job, stick it out for a bit. Embrace Python + dig deeper into SWE. 

I swear, it'll come together later in a future job.. maybe you'll productionize ML models, and suddenly be the superstar DS who codes well too. 

Or maybe you join an early-stage startup where they need a DS who can also code well too.",A lot of DS jobs are bait and switch. Your next one may be as well.
19-04-2023,69,Investing in Math Knowledge Better Than Learning Software Tooling for Career Longevity?,">Why is the “become a DS” industry so focused on the software side?

Because it is easier to teach someone an R/python library than it is to teach them math and soft skills.  You have to remember that these places are looking to turn a profit.","There’s diminishing returns as with everything. You won’t need those advanced models most of the time. Heck, you’ll most likely forget them. But all is not lost, your original study of it may help you identify the rare case you’d need an esoteric model and apply it. 

Software tooling on the other hand is more generally useful and immediately impactful. 

Pick whatever you need for your role and other roles you see in the market. Want to get into time series forecasting? Get learning etc…","Hate to sit on the fence, but the value of a data scientist comes from knowing enough math to understand what to do and enough programming skills to know how to do it. Being strong in both (and having the skills to understand business problems and communicate etc.) is practically the job spec of a data scientist."
08-09-2023,66,Let's bring some positivity to this sub: Tell us about your positive experience(s) in the space.,"> How has data science changed your life for the better?

$$$$$$$$","Here: I got into DS internship in the middle of my Physics degree, after a couple of months they offered my full-time Junior DS position. Since I first came there I was included in every possible meeting with client, brainstorming sessions or even took part in deciding where to go for a project or not. For me it has been very busy time but I’ve learnt so much. Now, 2 years forward I work as a regular DS and have my own small team in this company and I lead projects from the very first meeting with client to deploying it on production. If it hadn’t been for that internship (obligatory during my degree) I wouldn’t have been here where I am today.","Used to be in academia and I was massively anxious and depressed. It went on for so long that I thought I was broken. Therapy didn't help. There were not enough hours in the day to do all the things that were demanded of me, so I worked my ass off and always felt like I wasn't doing enough. Was paid below poverty wages. 
Now I work for a large company in a DS position that's really more DA but I'm not complaining. I have a real paycheck, real benefits, real work life balance. I like my colleagues. They value my work and my perspective. I am still anxious but no longer depressed. In my case it was simply that being in a very toxic environment made me feel like shit and once that changed I was finally able to find myself again. The work I do has very little to do with my research and many many many years of training. It's not revolutionary. It's not changing the world. It's not cutting edge. But it's what I needed. Some room to breathe and to enjoy my family."
10-06-2023,64,Has anyone here completed a sabbatical recently?,"Yes, I took a sabbatical and it was awesome. I studied, worked on projects I cared, traveled.

But unfortunately is true what someone else told you: the burnout is a symptom of your relationship with the work, and it will come back once you get back from the sabbatical. You have to understand what aspect of the work leads to burn out.","If you are looking for advice on taking a sabbatical, then I highly recommended it. I’m about to go come back from a sabbatical. It was the best decision I ever made. I won’t go in details of what I did, but I pursue my dream. Now, your job could be your dream, but people don’t usually get burn out from pursuing their dream. For what to do - anything that makes you happy. Travel, take a class, find a hobby, work on something you always want to do but never have the time. Good luck.",An official sabbatical can be hard to obtain because if you’re needed they won’t let you leave and if you’re not needed they may not hire you back. I did funemployment several years ago and really enjoyed it. I gave myself 3 months before applying because I didn’t want a huge gap on my resume. Was back to work after 4.5 months. I wouldn’t recommend it in this economy.
26-08-2023,65,Meaningful work -my company or all of data science?,"I'll state two points, one specific to your case and one generic:

1. Seems like you're just getting started so the problems aren't as exciting for now. It gets really fun with challenging problems and DS is big, like huge and there are many places to go towards but sometimes you just do what's required and the person setting the requirement doesn't know much. So, you should explore a little before settling.
2. I hear a lot of people that say we don't want to make CEOs money or them not feeling rewarded for their DS work and it's a bit surprising for me because you're working with data and maths and you picked an industry, how is it surprising to you that you're not curing cancer, it's not a directly rewarding job unless it's on the research side actually crunching numbers to cure cancer. But also data can be in itself exciting, and that's the point, the insights you can get, the stories you can tell and the models you can make is the impressive part about data science. It has immense room for creativity but no it's not a field that can feel rewarding unless you feel rewarded during the process.","For me, working in the right industry is as important or even more important than the actual tasks I have in the job. Most of the aspects of self-fulfillment are related to the bigger picture that you're contributing to with your work. Maybe the insurance industry just doesn't align with your interests.","So I can't say that it is always meaningful, but I think in biotech (especially R&D) we get to solve pretty interesting, complex puzzles.

From what it sounds like, you aren't working on things that are complex or interesting."
07-02-2023,66,"Are ""easy apply"" LinkedIn jobs even worth it?",When I was applying for jobs I’d do like 20 easy apply and 5-10 traditional applications a day. I honestly don’t remember if I got any interviews from the easy applies but it takes only a second so there’s really no downside to it,"I actually tried it twice recently, and it worked for these 2 positions. I got a call from HR and scheduled interviews.

I wouldn’t bet on this process but experience proved me wrong lol","I've personally never heard back from a LinkedIn easy apply job but as always, it's a numbers game. When I was on the other side and had to assist in hiring, we had over 1000 applicants to sort through. The highest qualified would never respond the take home assessment so if you can get lucky enough to get to that round your chances might actually be good. The person we ended up hiring was probably no better than the top 25% of applicants, he just happened to get his resume viewed at the right time and turned in his take home assessment. You'd be surprised how low quality many of those applications are...there is definitely some kind of Indian resume ring that caught hold of our posting and was spamming candidates with nearly identical resume templates and wording. (quick aside, I just want to be clear that I am not pro-THA, it wasn't my call and it drove away soooo many applicants)."
02-08-2023,63,U.S. Hiring Managers: how diverse is your applicant pool?,Getting an advanced degree is maybe the easiest sure-fire way (and it's definitely still not easy or sure-fire!) to be able to get a green card. DS often requires advanced degree.,"Interesting. I'm from the US and a native English speaker with a PhD and constantly rejected from all the DS roles I applied to over the years. The only time I had a DS title was after the org went through restructuring of everyone's titles, and I moved from DA to DS (though the duties my boss wanted me to perform were not DS at all..). All the DA titles I had, no matter what actual work I did, is probably the reason for all the rejection - I get it; a lot of automatic rejection based on that.

All that aside, I think business acumen, speaking to stakeholder groups, and presenting results clearly would be important for both DS and advanced DA roles, but that likely depends on the company and what jobs they actually need done at the time of hiring. Also, I've worked with plenty of DS from the US who are native English speakers and terrible communicators! So being a native English speaker definitely does not make you a great communicator/presenter automatically...","I see a pretty similar trend when I screen resumes.

In general, the brightest American kids are going into high paying jobs in law, finance, medicine, consulting, and tech.  All straight out of undergrad or the required professional school.

Of those going into tech, the easiest path is just doing SWE because it doesn't require grad school, and if you're good at it, offers equal or higher pay and more flexibility than DS.

So basically, if you're American and you're generally talented and have technical chops, there are easier and more lucrative options than shlepping it as a data guy.  Those options also tend to reward communication ability, which is easier as a native English speaker, so you have less competition from foreigners.

The diversity of your applicant pool is also a function of the kind of company you are.  Young hip startup --> probably more Americans.  Old boring enterprise company (which is more likely to sponsor visas, crucially) --> probably more foreigners."
20-06-2023,65,How much time of your job is spent reviewing theory that you've forgotten?,"Practically none because the modeling is the smallest part of the job, it probably averages maybe 5-10 minutes a week.","What do you actually mean by ""theory""? Are we talking maths or statistic basics? Or how to use certain packages?

I have to cover a really broad field in my day to day job so I often do stuff I have actually not much knowledge about. Like right now, I got a new project that involves computer vision. So I spend lots of time today scanning literature to figure out how it works and what open source packages I could use. I did not study some super theoretical basics even though I don't know them. I just want to get the job done.","Uhhh once in a while when I'm touching stuff outside of my core expertise, but most of the time I'm within it so don't need to. Plus I do read papers all the time to keep up, which has the ancillary effect of ensuring my theoretical fundamentals never gets too forgotten.

Perhaps you're new? I think early on that is more common, don't worry about it buddy."
06-08-2023,65,"Is anyone skilled in both DS and DE? If so, how much of an advantage did that give you in the job market?","Makes a huge difference. Being good at cloud engineering and CI/ CD means you’re in control of your data eg modelling, versioning and monitoring.

Then you can build and deploy models with confidence as well. I can direct work and set requirements when I’m not doing it myself, so that everything works together as it should to produce some meaningful business value.

I’ve gone from analyst, to scientist to principal engineer over the last 7-8 years; it would not have been possible without a strong understanding of all the components of DS/ DE/ DA.","From what I've witnessed, that tends to lead to people being hired on and paid like a DA but expected to do the work of a DS and DE.",If you work at a small/medium company it can make you twice as valuable because you can actually run a project end-to-end.
27-06-2023,63,"Didn't get the job at an interview because of ""Mistakes made"" but can't find them.","Unsure if this is the correct take for this, but perhaps it is as simple as what you thought they were asking didn't map to what they were asking? I'd always clarify that you understand the question, such as saying ""Do you mean in the Key Indicators of Performance of Models, or of Data Scientists within a company?"" Etc. This type of clarification is useful in general and can help avoid situations where you have made potentially incorrect assumptions. However, this line of thinking is speculation, maybe you answered perfectly and just weren't a good fit. Could be any multiple reasons going forward, job hunts end up being a game of right person, right place and right time.","Talent acquisition girl has 10 interviews to go to. She has been asked to ask 4 feeder questions, someone told her some words to listen out for as she might not be an expert herself. If you don't say the magic words but someone else does, you're cut. 

I think it's probably that simple..!","Questions 1 and 2 are incredibly dumb. It would be totally reasonable to ask something about coin flips (“what’s the chance of getting two heads in a row”, etc) but I cannot see why I would care if someone knows the name of the distribution (particularly because a Bernoulli is technically a special case of the binomial distribution)."
05-05-2023,60,"As an engineer moving into the DS field, I got my first job offer. Does it sound reasonable?","IMO, that's an acceptable salary and it's the direction you want your career to go. By the time you find a better job offer you could have worked there for a year and be getting ready to hop again. Companies are also tightening their belts in this fiscal environment, so it could make job offers a little more difficult to land for the immediate future. So, I lean towards taking it and looking to move up in a year or so when you feel more comfortable with the role.","Your job is to find a better job is a useful framing. A hop is useful if it's helping train you in the skills needed for the next job. You can make the call on the cost benefits on whether salary dips are worth the skills acquired. A dip is probably cheaper than opportunity cost of a return to school, getting paid to learn is better.","The only thing I would be concerned about is if you believe the other DS team members will be good people to learn from and if there are enough new projects flowing in to keep you busy and learning, since the DS team is new for the company. 

Don't listen to people critiquing the salary. That's a great starting salary. Just look at glassdoor. Across all industries, the average base pay is $103,000. You have zero experience and we have no idea where the job is located, so being just below average makes perfect sense. The only people that seem to ~~brag~~ talk about their salaries also happen to live in SF or NYC working for a FAANG company or some massive hedge fund."
15-09-2023,62,Data Scientists who feel their job is soul crushing which field do you work in?,"Not me, but my boss worked in mobile gaming before this. Optimizing timing and scale up of micro transactions. A big part of it was playing with the frequency of dopamine hit screens when players level up, giving a lot and tapering them off (inducing withdraw) and more likely to buy gems/upgrades 

Edit: to complete the story, she quit after doing a study trying to convert big fish to “whales”. A handful of players were spending >$10k/month, with an average transaction of $100. The whales would click on purchase ads about once an hour, and something about that grossed her out enough to decide she couldn’t do it anymore",I worked in marketing for years. Your analysis must always be positive and match what sales already told the client.,Somewhere where they call me a data scientist but all i do is dashboards and power points.
04-08-2023,60,What does it mean to work with ETL/ELT in the industry? Practical examples?,"ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) is a design pattern for data architecture with variations such as ELT or EtLT. There are vendors available, such as Fivetran or Portable, that have pre-built connections that they manage.

Here are two examples of ELT/ETL in action.

ETL:
- Your organization is starting to have more questions about about historical trends and patterns of your data.
- Currently, the org only has a transactional database (OLTP) for the product, and running these heavy analytical queries runs the risk breaking the transactional database for the product.
- Thus, you decide to replicate the data on an database designed specifically for analytics (OLAP) to power these heavy queries while not risking the production transactions database.
- You build an ETL pipeline to replicate data from the transactional database to the analytical database, including some data transformations to make it easier to use.

ELT:
- Your organization purchases third party data from a vendor to supplement your organization's data.
- While this third party data is useful, the vendor provides extremely messy tables.
- Since this data is for R&D purposes, there is no defined business logic available.
- Therefore, you deem its okay to dump this data into a data lake and give the data science team access to explore.
- You build an ELT pipeline that extracts the raw data from the third party vendor and loads it into the data make.
- After a few iterations, the data science team has determined which parts of the data are valuable, and build data transformations on top of the data in the data lake for their workflows.

Hope this helps!",Basically you’re taking source data and transforming it to your companies data model for inbound. Vice versa for outbound,"Yeah that's pretty much all there is to ETL. It is just extract, transform, load. Each step of that sequence can obviously be as complex as you would like it to be and directed towards what you want it to.

ETL is not some fancy software, it is literally just a design pattern for moving and transforming data. You can make an ETL pipeline in the kid language Scratch if you want to.

Amazon explains it pretty well and they are also interested in people understanding the material, not stroking some professor ego.

29-06-2023,62,What does Power BI offer?,"Power BI performs better with large datasets compared to Excel. In my opinion, expert Excel skills are a little easier to pick up, but Power BI is definitely a more powerful tool. Some of the people at my company also love being able to view Power BI reports on their phone, not sure if there’s an equivalent in Excel. 
Power BI is definitely more user friendly than distributing something like a Jupyter Notebook. Most consumers of data at companies I’ve worked at freak out if they feel like they have to do anything with a programming language, but that could depend on the org.","Power BI allows you to create and share interactive reports. It's tightly integrated with the Microsoft ecosystem, which can be a huge advantage in terms of deployment etc. A lot can be done with no or low code, which can be an advantage in some circumstances.","* easy access controls
* single sign on
* row level user access to data as needed 
* drill down and drill through
* ability for power users to build their own reports
* paginated reports and dashboards
* auditing of who’s viewing dashboards and usage stats
* visuals that update automatically once data sources are updated
* gui based builder so no programming experience needed (BI analyst is cheaper than a Data Scientist) to build reports/dashboards
* automated text analysis of data (LLMs May change this)"
01-06-2023,59,My experience transitioning from full-time to freelancing,"Wow this is inspiring, people always complain they can’t get anything off upwork and fiverr because it’s just too saturated.

07-03-2023,59,AMA: Broke into DS without masters,"So basically, you got some sort of “professional experience” (the quotes don’t mean it’s not real, it’s basically saying it’s taking the place of an internship) which you leveraged in your job hunt.

I don’t think that’s applicable to most other people here (who are out of school looking for a transition, but it’s good experience to share for students currently in school nonetheless.","I am also a DS with < 2 years of total work experience and a bachelor's in a non CS/Math field (Neuroscience). I started my first role as an analyst and pivoted into working on a full-fledged ML project that I was able to showcase on my resume & in my interviews. After about a year in my first role I began interviewing for DS positions and landed one at a fortune 10 company!

Edit: All this is to say, as OP has said, this is certainly possible! This being said, I am planning on starting a master's in DS soon not to break into the field but for the knowledge.",Most DS jobs don't require a masters
04-05-2023,62,Shiny for Python is out of Alpha,"Great! I use to work a lot in shiny with R over 5 years ago, but I had to switch to flask, dash, or streamlit since I needed to work in python. I am excited to build a shiny app again.","As someone that has worked with Shiny (R) as well, the barrier of entry in streamlit is lower.","Weird that they ported it over. I used it back in 2018, but there’s much better solutions for dashboarding in python. Others have mentioned Dash. I think plotly has their own variant, but I’ve been using Apache Superset which allows CSS formatting, you can change branding/flavor icons, and all the charts/dashboards can be imported/exported from JSON, which makes it much easier for a deployment standpoint. Also has row level security and supports Oauth so is a lot more secure than Shiny."
13-02-2023,62,Do you use tools for automatic EDA? Which ones? Why?,Pandas-profiling is about the extent of auto EDA I'm comfortable with.,"I made a R code for that! Took me almost a week, but now the EDAs take 5 min…","You should have functions/classes and plotting tools that make the EDA quick, not automatic. Then extensions for specific domains, time series is a good case where a lot of it can be automated because there are steps that you always should do."
27-08-2023,58,How to isolate effect of each variable out of 10 variables where every variable is highly correlated with each other?,"Is your goal prediction or inference?

If it’s the latter, we have a lot more work to do than the former","It seems that you are dealing with a difficult inferential task. If I would be you, I'd post your question on r/askstatistics and r/statistics and give some mote details, maybe a concrete example if you are allowed to. There are quite a lot of statistics phds in those subs that usually give great responses for well written and interesting questions.","What do you mean by ""highly"" correlated?

You are never going to truly get variables that are independent to one another, even if many times we call them that.

If you have multicollinearity, the main problem is going to be the inefficiency as the SE of the coefficients is going to be wrong and then, the hypothesis tests/confidence intervals are going to be wrong. The coefficient estimates themselves are not going to be biased, though.

You can try centering the variables and calculate VIF with and without centering. I'd do that as a first step. 

Ridge and Lasso can also be better if you have multicollinearity."

04-08-2023,61,What model should I use? Predicting if a client would like a song or not.,"Half of my job is dealing with recommendation systems in real life.A more appropriate approach for this type of recommendation problem is collaborative filtering, specifically using matrix factorization techniques like Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) or Alternating Least Squares (ALS). Collaborative filtering takes into account the past behavior of users and tries to find latent factors that represent user preferences and song characteristics.  


A nice easy to use framework is LightFM, that I use myself in production today.  [https://making.lyst.com/lightfm/docs/home.html](https://making.lyst.com/lightfm/docs/home.html)   


It can handle explicit as well as implicit rating schemes.",Subtle distinction - are you trying to predict who will like the song (binary) or who will vote that they like the song (multi-nomial and added component of consumer behavior)?,"You can use IP and UserAgent to pretty uniquely identify people. Even within 20 people working at a single office, you will probably find uniqueness.

I think having 2 songs would greatly improve the results but assuming you cant...

You can try 100 different models but i think feature engineering would be where you want to put effort. E.g. instead of location, have location=artist location or language=artists language"
25-07-2023,58,Why the 'Science' in DS?,"Not everyone in the industry agrees on this, but here's my take:

If you are applying the scientific method, then you're doing science. Some data scientists do this often: peforming controlled experiments or quasi-experiments using large volumes of data to gain new knowledge. ML is sometimes in this category, and sometimes not.

We also do engineering: formulating problems, defining resources and constraints, and designing/building solutions within that space.

IMO the Science label is reasonable, but can't realistically be applied to every DS job description.","Research and understanding vs building and creating. In practice (especially in industry you end up doing both quite a bit). I'd argue a decent analogy being that most software engineers studied computer science, ultimately it's not incredibly important but we do like to classify!","The title came from a job role that involves the scientific process then, when the mass influx of unqualified people being put in glorified analyst positions happened, people doing science and analysts not doing science ended up with the same job title."
04-03-2023,60,"Anybody else here in a DS and adjacent team in a Cold Civil War with sales just dumping requests on you because their ""job is to bring money in""?","There is nothing wrong with sales dumping requests on the data science team. There IS something wrong with not having a gatekeeper of some sort who has the power to prioritize and even reject said requests, depending on potential value of the request.",If you give quality prospects to sales people they’ll love you.,"As others have stated, this is a process/management issue. I work in Marketing Analytics at a large company building lead pipelines for many sales teams across multiple brands. We are a small team and the number of ad-hoc requests was becoming a problem. We changed our processes, adopted a quasi-sprint structure, became super transparent with the work each of us was doing and filtered new requests through the Data Science and Data Engineering leads. Additionally, if ad-hoc requests did come in to individual team members we started asking “how urgent is this/when do you need this by?”

This has drastically improved the situation and things seem to run much smoother now. If a truly urgent request does come in and I need to drop something else to work on it, my manager and the director of the department both know about the sacrifice to the project being delayed and those expectations are reset to the various stakeholders. Again, those decisions are made by managers acting as gatekeepers.

I cannot overstate how effective simply asking someone how urgent their request is. We were getting so many ad-hoc requests and just reactively handling them. When, in reality, had the requester been asked the urgency/importance, or been told it would take a few days/week to look at their issue, they would have happily dropped it, said it was not important, or handled it themselves."
29-01-2023,62,Which laptop would you recommend for data scientist / statistician?,"Most of your work will be done on the cloud, so what's the point of a $3000 laptop??","Have her company start paying for a cloud-based service for scientific computing (Databricks, AWS Sagemaker + S3, Azure ML in that order), then use a regular MacBook Pro for meetings & presentations.","$3200 is a lot money for a laptop... But anyway, Dell XPS, the 64GB version so she can run pretty much everything under the Sun and RTX 3050 Ti in case she wants to play around with GPU inference/eval too (4GB RAM not enough for training but that goes for almost any  laptop).

Then it's ""production code"".

Now deploying it is another beast...",For me I use the phrase when I want a meeting to end early. Nothing empties a Teams call faster than mentioning production code.,"I would agree with you want it to mean as you’re delivering software at the end of the day, but I do think it varies by industry/maturity. 

In organizations where tech/software is a core part of their strategy/competitive advantage, I’ve found they have very SE principles which is a fantastic.

07-07-2023,59,Book Review (Practical Statistics for Data Scientists 50+ Essential Concepts Using R and Python),"Is it worth it; 
yes if your actually go page by page, read it, actually wrote the code out, understand it and apply yourself. Does it have everything? No. As a data scientist, you really should focus on learning how to learn not memorizing everything; know when and how to use something rather than memorizing something you may never use. Knowing statistical things exist and that you can look them up as needed is incredibly important though. It’s ok to not know things.

How to read it? 
100% up to you; I suggest reading it from cover to cover, doing the code, maybe no more than an hour a day at a time. After each chapter, write the top 3 most important things down. At the end of the book pick the top 1 from each chapter and write it down in the cover of the book, then when needed just reference the front cover as a refresher.

I think the final two questions you have asked have been answered in my other remarks.

Read with purpose. Take notes with purpose. Know the why behind why the author wrote this; understand why it has value, then practice putting that value to work.

Good luck and enjoy the read.","It's just a field handbook. Dip into the relevant section as needed.

It's good enough to get that very short term business problem fixed (like replacing a flat tire with Spinifex is a fix) but you'll really need more depth in order not to drop a clanger.

Even the references are just to introductory books.

For a reasonable introduction to stats for data science that won't lead you to shoot yourself in the foot, I swear by ""Statistical rethinking"".



Deeply Bayesian, but the thought processes it teaches are top notch.

Oh. Free PDF and there are videos of lectures to go with the book, along with suggested pathways.","I finished this book recently. Imo is a good well written book. Do not expect it to dive deep into ML and statistical concepts. However it gives you a good overview of the algorithms and their pros and cons, which is enough to arouse your curiosity. 

It is important to be aware of the methodologies and the available tools, although you might not understand them 100%. You know that they exist, so next time you face a problem you could come up with a solution easier."

Power BI can export directly to a power point. I imagine for your use case it would probably provide what you need more expediently than Jupyter notebooks.",I agree with the other comment. Try out power bi,"DA here - My bosses live in PowerPoint, and I prefer Excels charts for looks and customization over what I can get with python. 

My script connects to the database and dumps the data into an Excel workbook which updates the charts. Then link the charts when pasting into PowerPoint. Now you just have to update the links when you load the pptx file. 

So basically just run the py script then load the PowerPoint and hit update. Then go into settings to break all links and Save As so your audience isn’t prompted to update links when they launch the PowerPoint.

I even have Excel generate text summaries of the data (eg, Last Week’s Sales: +62 (+1.2%)) that I copy paste into PowerPoint

22-08-2023,58,My first data science app!,Nice job for your first app. I think you can start building on this. Try your hand at making a network visualisation or something like that.

NLP is a nice field to dip your toes into and you can do a lot with just statistical approaches that don't use any of the fancy models.,If we upload our chats do you store that data anywhere? Or is it only temporarily stored and then deleted?,"I think this is a great start. I know word clouds are a bit meh, but with new stakeholders they are often the first thing that gets requested so a great stepping stone.

I repeat that this is our plan and it’s trial and error. Really frustrating and frankly is starting to waste my time. I was this close to giving them a talking to. Instead of acknowledging the effort they just shit on it. I don’t like that. Not sure what to do either.,"Your boss is a perfect example at someone being promoted to a manager because they were good at their last job. She doesn’t have the emotional intelligence needed to mentor you because she expects you to solve problems the way she does. If she really wanted that then she should have hired more experienced workers.

Anyway, I would ask her for a general guideline on how she would come up with initiatives. Steps that she would take, how to determine the pain point from stakeholders, etc… This is something you’ll have to speak about in a meeting and frame it see how you can benefit her.

Anytime she asks if you thought of this or that, ask her what else she would consider doing. And yes, you should be googling things before coming to her but after doing that, you can say you feel stuck after researching and would like her recommendations to solve the problem.","Sounds like a total nightmare. Honestly…I think you need to find a job where they value you and aren’t playing silly games/politics!

10-08-2023,59,Modeling in Banking - what modeling do you do?,"I am in a macro modeling group. I've done a lot of CRE and Wholesale loss forecasting and revenue growth modeling. 

I can pretty much do anythibg related to ccar/cecl/dfast stress testing or credit scoring along different products. I've worked at predominantly large global banks in Europe and US.

Fraud detection is probably where the most interesting work is, but few banks really build that stuff in house. More often then not model development in that space is maintaining a vendor product and customizing it to a specific strategy",I work for a bank but am curious to know what modeling is like. I know its heavily regulated and documentation is more a part of the job than actual modeling.,"I built a banking model many moons ago: credit scoring, credit risk, AML, and a customer cross-sell model."
01-08-2023,56,Is Freelance work on the weekends a thing?,"I live in a tech hub city and get approached by recruiters constantly for “freelance”, “gig”, or “consulting” jobs which all basically pan out to be 10-15hrs a week doing little things for startups on a contract basis. Typically pays about $20 an hour for a 100 hour contract.","It's pretty rare.

If you want to model a process, more data means that you can better model that process. So decent models require large amounts of data.

Typically, the first things companies log properly are processes that are part of their core business. And that data is really valuable, also for their competition. Working with something valuable close to a company's core business is not a good fit for a part time freelancer: just getting the green light for any project at all is expensive, so even though as a freelancer you're cheap, the project will still be expensive. And if something happens to you, they're out of their investment.

So you're left with companies that are basically looking for someone to build a product that they would buy off the shelf if it existed. And at that point, you'll be competing with start-ups that might have an investor and can sink hundreds of hours into it without charging the company anything.

Another option is to consult, but that's typically during workdays.","I've got an ongoing freelance gig that is more or less a weekend thing in the sense it usually takes a couple hours a week, though when I'm feeling like it I can do (and charge for) 10 or so.  It's a software job more than a data science one but it's really not rocket science.

I got it via a referral from another data scientist, the client was looking for a freelancer via codementor, and perhaps through other sites too. The job is basically about upkeeping a few legacy Python processing pipelines, and every now and then updating them. I think I was pretty lucky with this one as it is a long-term low stress gig."

Can you create value in your current role? That's all that matters. All that other junk will come in due time with your success and the success of the business. Startups are by nature messy and disorganized. If you're not up for it by all means keep looking, but don't waste your time on self study if you're not applying what you're learning to something that matters to a hiring manager (e.g., business, open source projects, volunteering, etc).","It sounds like the skills that are expected of you are those of a Data Engineer. If you learn about Data Engineering specifically, you will gain so many valuable skills for where you want to go down the line, opening you up to things like Machine Learning Engineering or MLOps. 

It sucks that you can’t use your Statistics and ML knowledge yet, but the #1 priority for data-immature orgs should be to set up data pipelines so that analyses can be done when enough data comes in. Data Engineering will teach you a lot about what you need to know for ML in a production environment, so try to look at this as a great opportunity! 

On the other hand, if you absolutely know for sure that Data Engineering has 0 appeal to you, then you might not fit with your current company, and that’s ok too","Unfortunately, all entry-level jobs are like this. Assuming that you only have your bachelor’s, what you are doing is likely the ceiling for these initial 1-2 years. 

Not sure how big the startup is, but at bigger companies they usually provide some structured trajectory. Something like: data analyst —2yr—> data engineer —2yr—> data scientist. Consider getting a MS if you plan on accelerating the process.

If you work at an early start up you will be expected to wear multiple hats. There's no real way around that. You can't really just ""stay in your lane"", you will need to go outside your comfort zone and learn some DE skills.

If this bothers you then you should consider applying externally. I promise you this will not be the only time you will be asked to do something outside your scope and comfort level.","If you're a data analyst, why can't you learn data engineering?

14-06-2023,58,Data science in banking sector,Logistic Regression 😂,"Can confirm, have worked with UK Banks for 12 years. Credit scoring is done using logistic model. I have worked on stress testing models as well which uses time series GLM model to predict PD. On the credit risk side most models are Regulatory so need to go through an internal model assessment committee (yes it's called a committee) before it goes to the regulators and this process literally run for years before the regulators just ask you to use overlays to get to the numbers they'd like to see.

The real joy was working in portfolio analytics and doing exploratory/inferential stuff. Things like how to quantify additional risk for a contact less card customer vs non contactless customer or what additional measures can the bank take to protect mortgage portfolio quality due to the changing macros such as increasing unsecured debt level in the economy.","Another banking DS graduate here (Ireland) that can confirm that it'll be logistic regression and decision trees as far as the eye can see.

03-06-2023,57,Should I stick to my job? Not enough coding/ML more BI than expected,"That’s like the majority of work that is really useful for business. Predictive analytics is hard and doesn’t work properly most of the times. Dashboards on the other hand do add value and help with decision making.

There are DS jobs where you do mostly modeling and advanced stats/math, but they’re very few and far between. Mostly, DS jobs tend to revolve around either data engineering/ETL/data processing or descriptive stats/visualizations.

Also, Jr. Data Scientist = Data Analyst, using BI tools instead of Python/ML is pretty much par for the course for this profession. So you do what you are supposed to do.

Bottom line - data scientist is a senior position and not many companies really need/can use predictive analytics. If you came to the industry expecting that you’ll use ML most of the time - you’ll be disappointed. My advice - stay and learn, if in a year or 2 there is no ML on your plate, think about jumping ship, but don’t expect that next ship is going to be much better.",In finance that role can be very lucrative,"You just graduated from a bachelor degree and have 6 months of experience.

However, it’s still just a job. I don’t expect my job to provide all of my fulfillment. I also have friends and family and hobbies and whatnot for that.

21-07-2023,54,Why are DS job descriptions so…diverse?,"Because data science isn’t a “real” field but a hosh posh of several data related activities. Imagine a formula 1 driver, a truck driver and a taxi driver being put into one category because they’re all “use wheel to drive a vehicle”. 

We are yet to see properly defined categories, which won’t happen until companies figure out a certain commonly accepted way of using data.","I mean just think about the job title. “Data Scientist” is like a title that a child would come up with. It’s inane. 

Right now the only purpose it serves is to let the applicant know they’ll be more highly valued by the company than someone with a title like “data analyst”.",Because DS is several jobs converging.

06-03-2023,53,How to be the first / lead data scientist in a team?,"Frankly, it's a really challenging position to be in. I had a similar experience, joining a non-tech company with \~2000 employees as their first data scientist. Here are some of the pitfalls I ran into:

\-Management doesn't know what they want, or what is possible, or what will have the biggest impact on the business. A lot of places are hiring DSs to magically produce ""insights"" that will make the company work better. They don't have any kind of real roadmap for how to make that happen.

\-The data is shit. One of the first things you should do is basic sanity checks on the data you have available. I found a ton of absurd things. Retail stores would have $0 in sales for a week, then $2M on Sunday. Most of my time was spent trying to get the software engineers who built the sales data platform to fix this stuff. They were in a different vertical, so I had to use ""influence in a matrix environment"" (common job posting phrase) to get them to do extra work. That turned out about as well as you'd expect.

\-Management doesn't know how, or is culturally unable, to use what you build. One thing I was able to make was a tool to predict sales for different models of items. It was faster, easier, and more accurate than the spreadsheet we'd been using. The feedback I got was, ""Well, it's Sally's job to do this forecasting. What's she going to do now?""

I was just totally unable to make a dent. Fortunately I got a fantastic offer from a different firm and left after just under a year.","No offense, but it doesn’t sound like you’re really qualified to build out a dept/practice.

Speaking from experience I struggled to land a DS role after my PhD, landed a senior analyst role and internally transferred to DS. Others I knew took junior DS jobs, so straight out of masters you’re going to struggle even for junior positions. 

Best bet is probably to get an analytical role if any kind and try to move internally.",Generally places would want more experience before you get a DS role. Try looking for DA roles to get some experience first.,"The first ""entry level"" DS role I got, I had a Ph.D., 4 years experience as an analyst, and had already built and deployed ML models professionally.

1. New Product development. using DCM to find the optimal combination of features to make a new product.
2. repertoire optimisation. if a new product is developed will it find its own set of customers that appeals to a new customers or will it cannibalise existing product in the range switching the customers from one product to anther. that’s ok if the margin is larger but not if it’s the same or smaller. TURF analysis.
3. identifying gaps in the market by understanding consumer needs usually at a early stage to 1. above.
4. Pricing research to find the optimal pricing point. to sell the product at.
5. volume estimation. Once you have your new product and happy the repertoire analysis gives benefit and you know the optimal pricing point you need to understand the number of units you will sell at different levels of awareness and distribution. this will enable you to determine the amount of resource needed to build product lines of factories.
6. targeting this is often done with an attitudinal segmentation usually preceded by a large amount qualitative research to under stand the topics.
I could go on to me the question is silly. Data science clearly is needed to give direction all have quantifiable ROI.","1. Treatment/control of your model -- takes about a month to two months to set up per model, depending complexity, scale, and how many platforms are integrated

2. Deliver/control of your model results -- measure how effective your client is at delivering your model results

3. Calculate uplifts combining 1. and 2. as a Punnet square, freezing your model delivery and check results in X months or so (could be 3 months, 12 months, etc., depending customers' purchase rhythms, for example if they buy milk twice a week, then 3 months would be more fitting, if they buy phone every 2 years, then 5 years would be more fitting, etc.)

4. Check against the negotiation contract with the client (can't do this without fiscal transparency)

5. Check against your (team's) salaries (assuming you spend 100% of your salaried time with that client, otherwise, set up a system to keep track, though this isn't feasible for many)

Some people may quit the job because the uplift was far higher than the negotiation contract and salary.

These are the five basic layers with example warnings in a short summary. It takes a lot of time to set up, lots of communication requirements, transparency, and authority. If you have all these characteristics, then it may be worth pursuing. If you're in communicative silos, it's already not a great sign.","Much of this stuff isn't unique to ONLY consumer goods, but it's been used.

We've done stuff to predict traffic which can be used to help predict sales (that one gets complicated). We've done stuff to predict which customers are most likely to pay with and without human intervention (to wholesale customers, etc.). This is basically just collections optimization. We've done stuff to predict service/warranty costs.

A lot of this, at a portfolio level, falls under analytics. It's when we start trying to narrow down which one(s) will be impacted that it falls into data science (my version of the definition)."
05-08-2023,54,What kind of companies actually do modeling as opposed to outsourcing modeling work?,"Companies go through cycles of outsourcing and onshoring:

* Offshore seems cheap, so they switch slowly
* Offshore sucks (doesn't know business, requires too much hand holding, need more back and forth and timezones slow things down, inflated hours, etc...) so it ends up seeming like onshore is more viable. 
* Hire onshore people (thinking they'll be more engaged, more productive, more in tune with the business).
* Those people get expensive and offshore seems cheap. Everyone who saw the problematic times has left. Cycle repeats. 

Right now, a lot of companies are hiring contract-based resources because of ""the recession that we shall not say its name""... they're hedging against full time employees so they can easily adjust (fire) resources when needed.   


When the economy comes out of whatever it is, the companies that offshored will probably want to onshore...","I work at a fortune 100.

* Data sources (number of data sources, volume, type, where are they stored?)
* Data model currently being used (Data warehousing, data lake, delta lake, data mesh etc.)
* ETLs 
* Reports that it's serving (what are they feeding into, how are they being consumed?)
* Data usage across the business (maybe even data literacy as well but that might be a bit tough)

If OP is dealing with lots of features, lasso regularization is the way to go. That regularization leads to sparse feature sets as many features tend to become zero with penalty. So it kinda does feature selection itself","Try regularisation.

 I work on very high dimensional data, 
So I build a simple xgboost model and get most important attributes, run a regularisation on it and then build my final model.

Edit: Just went through the whole argument in the thread related to using xgboost as feature selection method and then using these features in a linear model. 

There are potential problems when using this method , like features having non linear relationship , collinearity in variables, over fitting, etc. 

For collinearity and overfitting, we can just run some checks. 

The other problem that xgboost will return non linear features and may miss out linear features. 
For that what I generally do is perform some test to check linearity and then once I have a final logistic regression model , check if any of the excluded variable improves model performance. 

I do this by using RFE and then include most important variables from this method and then see if model performance improves and if the newly added variables make it into having very high importance in logistic regression model.

That happens along several dimensions.

* Working independently. Senior employees require little to no managerial direction. For senior employees your manager is a resource to help unblock you, not to guide you. Junior DS solve problems they are given, Senior DS proactively find problems and solve them.
* Work on projects with wider scope. What this means will be company specific (the available scope at a small e-commerce startup is necessarily smaller than the that at a FAANG), but in general a senior DS will have impact that spans a larger part of whatever space is available.
* Business/product sense: the dirty not-so-secret thing for success as a DS is that technical acumen matters a lot less than having a strong understanding of the business. Someone with a very high degree of technical mastery but limited product sense is almost by definition not going to be able to drive as much impact as someone whose has the opposing balance. That's not to say that technical mastery doesn't matter of course, and especially at very large companies there is room for tech masters. But in many cases tech mastery will only get you so far.
* Influencing stakeholders to drive business results: Training models and generating insights is all fine and dandy, but you need to get the company to *do something* with those insights.
* Acting as a force multiplier for other DS: lots of ways that this happens: mentoring, tech advising, etc. The whole idea is that as you become more senior your work will less and less resemble sitting around with your datasets and your various notebooks and more and more look kind of like managing, only you don't have the manager title.","Juniors focus on technical knowledge

Yes.

Neither of these things \*need\* to have a major impact on your WLB, but at the same time, they'll still require more effort than just cruising along at your current level on autopilot.

This is quite common for new analysts who are just learning the ropes, learning about the domain they're in, and are just starting. Don't beat yourself up!

Stating exactly how many rows you started with and why each bundle got dropped or added it a good way to uncover mistakes before someone else does.

They usually work on very high-level projects directly with leadership, and often lead projects that other data scientists contribute to. Usually they also mentor others. But they don’t manage any direct reports. Their salaries are often on par with department managers/directors and sometimes VPs.","This is a problem for all technical roles.

It means being more focused on the design of the project and ensuring that deliverables are mapping to business outcomes than it does doing hands on data work. 

At the end of the day, you can only advance so much doing hands on data work, since you’re just one person, and your seniority generally will map 1:1 with your impact at the company. That’s not to say that you will never do technical work as a senior+ IC (especially if you have a very specific area of expertise that is business critical and not shared by the rest of the company).

09-05-2023,53,Too much data at my company. How do we organize our strategy?,"I'm in a GCP org, so I'm going to use that terminology. I assume that similar is available on the other cloud platforms.

I would start with three pieces of infrastructure: a data warehouse, some kind of workflow automation/orchestration system, and a dashboarding/exploration tool. 

We use BigQuery as our warehouse, Cloud Composer (hosted Airflow) for orchestration and Metabase as a dashboarding tool and I am very happy with all three, but especially BigQuery.

You want to have a copy of all of your company's data in the warehouse. I would recommend first automating a process to get all of the raw data into the warehouse. Then build further automation to clean it up inside of the warehouse as you need clean data. Sometimes this is called ELT. 

Eventually you'll have a lot of stuff in clean form and it will be ""easy"" for people to explore and interact with the cleaned data, but you'll always have everything available in its original messy form if you need to answer one-off questions or explore.

If software devs need to deliver data to you periodically, have them dump the data in a GCS bucket. Best case, they use parquet format because it's strongly typed and well structured. Second choice would be \`.jsonl\`, last choice \`csv\` or other text formats. Bonus points if they can deliver the data in sharded form. 

Likewise, you may eventually be dumping out data in the same way for others to consume..eventually. 

When you want to do stuff locally on a workstation, prep the data in BigQuery, dump it out to a GCS bucket in parquet format, download that, and suck it into your python/whatever code, then put the results back into BigQuery. 

Avoid pandas. use SQL as much as possible. Keep analysis in BigQuery as much as possible. Virtually anything you do in BigQuery will scale gracefully over time.

A good web-based dashboarding tool will allow you to easily surface results to others, enable them to explore, and enable you to demo or explore data live with other people in a way that is a lot more elegant than a Jupyter notebook. 

This is a kind of minimal setup, but you can do everything from product analytics to machine learning or recommendation systems on this basic fabric, it's all pretty easy to spin up, and it's a very productive environment.",This is much bigger than a data science problem.,This is more than just one persons job and why is your boss or others in the team not doing anything?

22-04-2023,55,"What is the purpose of a confusion matrix in machine learning? How do you interpret the different metrics (such as precision, recall, F1 score) from a confusion matrix?","One important purpose of the confusion matrix is making the quality of the model visible when the classes are imbalanced. If you have a binary classification problem where 99% of your data points are negative, your model can achieve a 99% accuracy by always predicting ""negative"". Looking at the confusion matrix shows the strength of your model better.
Another case where the confusion matrix helps is when you want to weigh predictions by your model differently. E.g. if you are manufacturing parts and use your model to predict whether a part is faulty and needs to go for re-testing, you may want to send the part for re-testing when the model predicts a fault with a certain probability under 50% because you absolutely want to avoid faulty parts. What you can do to figure out this probability for the decision is to change the threshold and see how the confusion matrix changes until you have no more false negatives. I wrote this from my phone and might not have explained things super clearly. Let me know if you have questions!","A confusion matrix is a table used to evaluate the performance of a classification model in machine learning. It shows the number of true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives for each class in the dataset. The purpose of a confusion matrix is to help visualize how well the model is performing in terms of correctly predicting each class.In a confusion matrix, the rows represent the actual classes, and the columns represent the predicted classes. The four possible outcomes are:True Positive (TP): The model correctly predicts a positive class.False Positive (FP): The model predicts a positive class, but the actual class is negative.True Negative (TN): The model correctly predicts a negative class.False Negative (FN): The model predicts a negative class, but the actual class is positive.From a confusion matrix, several metrics can be calculated to evaluate the performance of the model. The most commonly used metrics are precision, recall, and F1 score.Precision measures the proportion of correctly predicted positive instances out of all positive predictions. It is calculated as TP/(TP+FP). Precision is a useful metric when the cost of false positives is high. (I recently came over this in ML class.) CUrrently studying at [Consoleflare.com](https://Consoleflare.com)","All of the metrics tell you something different and you should think carefully (don't go read about it, literally think through it yourself) what conclusions you can draw from the various metrics and in what situations they're important.  If you want to start with an easy one, read the definition of precision and think about the implications of precision in a scenario where false positives are costly. Then check your work against what others have written about it. Then do the same for recall, F1, etc."
30-01-2023,54,Is this how it really works?,Personal connections are a job finding cheat code. That’s always been the truth.,"Finding a way to get someone on the team to meet you for coffee and tailoring your application specifically to that company is like asking someone to prom by making a giant sign. It shows a high level of investment and commitment, but that's only a good thing if they already want you. Otherwise it just makes you look like a delusional loser. 

This is the advice that only works if you follow rule 1: be an attractive candidate.",I feel like if I shared any information about my company to anyone who bought me coffee would get me fired and sued

I'm not discounting the suggestions for teamwork improvement and presentations. But teamwork can also be boiled down to ""listening"" and I've never seen ""great presentations"" as a reason for getting a top bonus amount in my yearly review.",“Just Listen” by Mark Goulston & “Never Split the Difference” by Chris Voss,"Hey sub, let's start this one with theory."

23-08-2023,52,"new MS Data Science grad w/ 6mo data analyst internship, feeling really bummed out","\> ""not showing enough interest for the company""

You can start by learning about the industry of the company you are interviewing for. Learn about their competitors and ask them what they are doing to beat them. At the end of the interview, when they ask you for questions, ask them at least five questions about the company culture and how the interviewer got the role, etc.

You can also apply to Business Analytics role to move up to Data Science. You might be aiming too high. You gotta start somewhere.

\[EDIT\] If the company is public traded, then read their financial statements like their 10-K report. That will tell you a lot about the company's financial health and the competitors in their industry.",What about the job market in electrical engineering? Maybe you can leverage your data science skills to focus your career in the field of your bachelors,"How’s your project portfolio? If you want you can DM me  your resume and linked in. I currently work at a position that is essentially a DA for a streaming company (the title is Yield Manager, Yield Analytics). I got the job a year ago. I graduated with a BA in Econ, got the Data Analytics Google Cert, built a small project portfolio, and had 3 months temp experience as a Data Support Specialist for Berkshire Hathaway. I mainly got my current position for 3 reasons: 1) My project portfolio looked good and it got my foot in the door. It was good experience to speak on when i didn’t have any prior experience. 2) I talked up and even fibbed about what I did as a Data Support Specialist to make it sound like I did DA work. 3) They gave me a dataset to work on that i would have to present on in a week for the final round of interviews. I poured 8-10 hours into it every day, made a good presentation, and presented for friends and family about 8 times before the actual interview. I did very well on the presentation."
14-08-2023,50,What harshest advice would you give to me? Any feedback is appreciated,"I've done a fair bit of hiring of NLP-focussed data scientists, among other fields. 

Pros: 

* Your maths education looks good, I might be interested if I were hiring for a particularly theoretically rigorous role (e.g. sports betting, quant, ...).
* formatting/style is clean, quick, easy to read. nice one. 

Cons:

* I don't get a good sense of your coding abilities, doubly so not your DS coding abilities: ""employed NLP for keyword ..."" -> without stating tooling, I don't really know what to make of this. spaCy, Flair, NLTK, BERT , ... 
* I'd be really nervous about where you are at coding. Do you know anything about SWE? 
* Lack of internships (it happens, I get it) leads me to want to see *way* more on the projects side.
* I'd want to give your resume a chance, but the only place I can see that coming in is from your projects section. They are, however, poorly described.
*  The bullet-points don't work for the project section.
* None of the three orojects actually explain what the project was or **why** you did what you did. 

If this were one of <10 applications for an internship or very junior role, I'd be curious enough to go to your github. If that was impressive, I'd consider. Else, reject.  

**Action Point** (based on my own subjective hiring desires -- i'm just like.. some guy): 

Focus your projects section to tell a better story of how you thought about and carried through the tasks. What questions (did you ask and therefore) were answered? 

Hope this helps, really. Better yet if you can mix this response with a few others. 

Good luck!","Being harsh:

""Collaborated on..."", ""Delved into..."", ""...studied..."" = you haven't actually done anything yourself.

Show me your skills by showing me your successes. Sell the benefit (of hiring you) not the product (you).","Nice resume to go further in numerical physics or quant finance. Have you considered these fields? I would at least meet some data scientist in the industry to get a taste of what's going on in the real world of industry, and compare with the PhD path and the possible options after it."

21-02-2023,50,How impressive is a high Kaggle ranking for employers?,"For whatever it's worth:

I work in auto insurance and pivoted from undewriting to pricing analyst (and pivoted companies to do it).

I picked up a dataset from Kaggle from American autoinsurer AllState. I did some EDA and plots, ran a bunch of different regression models to predict accident severity ($ cost of claim) that got increasingly complex. After that, I did the same thing with gradient boosting.

This was years after the initial competition - I didn't even submit my results.

It did not come up in the interview naturally (questions were asked about my job, which had no data analysis let alone data science).

I asked to bring it up and showcase it.

I got the job. The work I do now focuses on rate changes and basic-intermediate data analysis. (Excel, Power Query/Pivot, R, SQL, Tableau). I make 55-75k.

While I (and several others) were hired from other companies, the role targets new grads. I got the job because I used linkedin to network.","I am surprised at the responses.

Honestly, resume content is a first rung intro. If you're a kaggle grandmaster applying for an ML job .. at least I'm going to take notice.

But that doesn't mean you skip the interview process.","No one cares about Kaggle. Can it be great learning from a high level perspective? Sure. Will you have the opportunity to learn about and apply some fancy, tuned, algorithms that will never be used in industry? Sure. If this is your only CV talking point when hunting for jobs, will you be turned down by most companies? Almost certainly. :)
